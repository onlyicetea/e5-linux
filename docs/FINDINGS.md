# Findings: booting Linux on the Rongyue E5

Everything here was measured on the device or read out of the stock images; items
that are still assumptions are marked **UNVERIFIED**. Device: Rongyue E5,
`ro.product.device=ums9158_1h10`, `ro.board.platform=ums9621`, model `E5`,
Android 13, stock kernel `5.15.119-android13-8-00018-ga78ea39db117-ab10710420`,
build `TS305_V03_20260113_2322`.

## 1. Boot chain

The E5 is a normal Android A/B device with an unlocked bootloader
(`ro.boot.verifiedbootstate=orange`) and the Android 13 GKI split:

| partition | contents | size |
|---|---|---|
| `boot_a` / `boot_b` | header v4; kernel (arm64 Image, EFI stub); ramdisk | 64 MiB |
| `init_boot_a` / `init_boot_b` | header v4, kernel_size 0, generic ramdisk | 8 MiB |
| `vendor_boot_a` / `vendor_boot_b` | VNDRBOOT v4, DTB in the kernel field, vendor ramdisk (~80 MiB) | 100 MiB |
| `dtbo_a` / `dtbo_b` | the device tree the bootloader actually passes | 8 MiB |
| `dtb_a` / `dtb_b` | all zero | 8 MiB |
| `misc` | `bootloader_control` at offset 0x800 | 1 MiB |
| `super` | logical partitions (system, vendor, product, …, vendor_dlkm) | 5.47 GiB |
| `userdata` | f2fs, mounted directly (no metadata encryption) | 21.86 GiB |

### Which ramdisk does LK use? boot.img wins

This decided the whole design, and the stock bootloader log (`uboot_log`
partition, 16 MiB) answers it directly:

    bootimage: generic ramdisk size is 360840
    bootimage: generic ramdisk offset is 0x2c98000
    ...
    bootimage: generic ramdisk size is zero, maybe ramdisk in init_boot image side!
    init_bootimage: generic ramdisk size is 1907183

LK takes the **generic ramdisk from boot.img**, and only falls back to
`init_boot` when boot.img's `ramdisk_size` is zero (which is the stock state:
stock `boot_a`/`boot_b` carry kernel only). The same log shows the two ramdisks
being loaded to separate addresses, so they are not simply concatenated either:

    vendor_boot_a ramdisk read OK, size = 80668385, locate to 0xc0000000!
    boot_a ramdisk read OK, size = 360840, locate to 0xc4cee6e1!

**Consequence:** the Linux kernel *and* the Linux initramfs both go into slot b's
`boot` image. `init_boot_b` and `vendor_boot_b` stay stock — which also
matters because LK AVB-verifies `init_boot` (`verify boot check init_boot`,
`partion init_boot, verify_ret:0x0`).

### Ramdisk compression must be LZ4 *legacy*

The stock and Magisk ramdisks both start with `02 21 4c 18` (LZ4 legacy frame,
not the modern `04 22 4d 18`). `boot/build-boot-image.py` compresses with
`lz4 -l` accordingly.

### AVB is not enforced

`ro.boot.verifiedbootstate=orange`, and the device currently boots a
Magisk-patched `boot_a` (`ramdisk_size=360840` where stock is 0) whose digest
cannot match the stock descriptor. The boot image builder therefore keeps the
stock header, the stock vbmeta blob and the stock `AVBf` footer byte for byte
and only repoints `original_image_size`/`vbmeta_offset` — the safe path, since
regenerated descriptors have produced `invalid vbmeta header` /
`ERROR_INVALID_METADATA` failures on this device before.

### Slots and `misc`

Live `misc` at offset 0x800 (32 bytes, CRC-valid):

    5f 61 00 00 42 43 41 42 01 02 00 00 9f 00 1e 00 ...
    "_a\0\0"  "BCAB"     v1 n2        a     b

This is the same AOSP `bootloader_control` structure mu300-linux documents for
the UMS9620: `slot_suffix[4]`, magic `BCAB`, version, `nb_slot`,
`recovery_tries`, `merge_status`, `slot_info[4]`, then a CRC32 over the first
28 bytes. `slot_info` bits are priority (4) | tries_remaining (3) |
successful_boot (1):

* slot a = `0x9f` → priority 15, tries 1, successful
* slot b = `0x1e` → priority 14, tries 1, **not** successful

`flash-trial.sh` writes a slot-b trial block derived from these live values:
slot a keeps a slightly lower priority and stays successful, slot b gets priority
15 with tries=2. LK decrements to 1 on the next boot, and — exactly as
mu300-linux found for this bootloader family — treats `tries==1 && !successful`
as an already-failed boot, so a Linux attempt that never completes rolls back to
Android. **UNVERIFIED on this device**: that the E5's LK implements the identical
decrement/rollback rule. The trial path is one-shot by construction, and
`boot/init` also restores the slot-a block explicitly before it reboots.

## 2. There is no free eMMC space — the rootfs lives in `/data`

mu300-linux puts its root filesystem in the unallocated region after `userdata`.
On the E5 there is no such region: `userdata` (partition 70) ends at LBA
61075455, exactly the GPT's `last_usable_lba` — **zero bytes free**.

    p70  first=15241216  last=61075455  size=21.86 GiB  userdata
    gpt  last_usable_lba=61075455  ->  free after last partition: 0 bytes

Rather than rewrite the partition table, e5-linux keeps mu300-linux's "do not
touch the GPT" property and stores the root filesystem as a file inside Android's
`/data`: **`/data/e5linux/rootfs.ext4`**. `/data` is f2fs mounted straight
from `mmcblk0p70` (no `dm-default-key` metadata encryption), so the Linux
kernel mounts it with the in-tree f2fs driver and attaches the file to a loop
device. Android's per-file encryption means the file itself is stored in the
clear — which is fine, it is expected to be readable by root only.

Trade-offs worth knowing: a factory reset or `fastboot -w` erases it, and
mounting f2fs read-write from Linux is only as safe as the last Android
shutdown. Both are acceptable for a bring-up that must not touch the partition
table; a later revision can shrink `userdata` and carve a real partition.

## 3. Module load order is not alphabetical

The stock Android first-stage list in `vendor_boot` is a hand-tuned 83-entry
subset of the kernel's modules, with ADI/PMIC/clock layers first and
`ump9620-regulator.ko` at position 18. Loading an alphabetical list puts
`ump9620-regulator.ko` first, where `dev_get_regmap()` returns NULL and the
driver dereferences it — first-stage init dies with no log at all. e5-linux ships
that exact order in `boot/module-order.stock` and `boot/stage-modules.sh`
filters it down to the modules this kernel actually built, so the initramfs
`insmod` order always matches the order the stock first-stage init used.

`sprd_wdt_fiq.ko` is at position 10 of that list and matters more than the rest:
it is the SoC watchdog, it feeds itself from its FIQ handler, and the bootloader
hands over with the watchdog armed (`sprdboot.wdten=e551`,
`androidboot.dswdten=enabled`). This model exposes **no `/dev/watchdog`** even
on stock, so there is no userspace way to pet it.

## 4. Log capture

A Linux boot attempt that fails gives no adb, no network and no ylog (Android
only archives ylog after a *successful* boot). Three channels are used:

1. **`boot/init` writes every stage to `/dev/kmsg` and `/dev/pmsg0`**, which
   land in `/sys/fs/pstore/console-ramoops-0` / `pmsg-ramoops-0`. The boot
   command line also registers ramoops early
   (`ramoops.mem_address=0xfff80000 ramoops.mem_size=0x40000 …`, the region the
   stock DT reserves at `ramoops@fff80000`), so output from a boot that dies
   before the DT-based initcall is not lost. This mirrors the mitigation recorded
   in `artifacts_e5/diagnostics_2026-09-09.md`.
2. **A 4 MiB persistent log at 56 MiB inside `boot_b`**, written by `boot/init`.
   Unlike pstore this survives a cold power cycle and is not overwritten by the
   next successful Android boot. `boot/build-boot-image.py` refuses to build an
   image that would overlap it.
3. **The bootloader log** in `uboot_log`, which is the only place that shows
   slot selection, ramdisk sizes and AVB results.

`tools/collect-logs.sh` pulls all three after the device is back in Android.

**In the switch_root path the block deliberately ends at `stage=switch-root`, and
that is not a bug.** The writer is the initramfs `init`; `switch_root` replaces
PID 1 and the initramfs goes away with it, so there is nothing left to write the
block. A block whose last stage is `stage=switch-root` therefore says the session got
all the way into the real root filesystem — which is exactly what the last run
recorded (`uptime=14.74`, `loaded=60 failed=0`, `default-boot-linux (slot a restore
skipped)`, `switch-root root=/disk init=/lib/systemd/systemd`). The last line
`boot/init` writes before handing over, `stage=switch-root-jobs-killed`, is only in
`/run/stages` inside the running system (`cat /run/stages`), never in this block.
Anything that happens after switch_root has to be logged from userspace: the block
cannot see it, so it cannot diagnose a session that dies later (see §9).

**In the standalone path — no root filesystem, `init` keeps running — the block used
to stop after its first successful write.** `persist()` takes a `/run/persist.lock`
directory so the periodic loop cannot race the caller, and it recorded the timestamp
*inside* that directory (`/run/persist.lock/stamp`) and released it with
`rmdir /run/persist.lock`. `rmdir` cannot remove a directory that holds a file, so
the release always failed; from then on every call either returned because the lock
looked younger than the two-minute staleness limit or, past that limit, failed to
re-create it. The lock-expiry logic could not save it either — the age test reads the
lock *path* itself (`cat /run/persist.lock`, a directory, always empty), and the
expiry's `rmdir` fails for the same reason. `boot/init` now keeps the stamp beside the
lock (`/run/persist.stamp`) and releases both with `rm -rf`. Note the contrast with
the campaign's run 1, which used an older `init` with no locking at all and did keep
writing every fifteen seconds right up to `uptime=276.28`.

## 5. Device-alive risks specific to this hardware

* ~~**Charging has no driver path.**~~ **Superseded — see §7.2.** The E5 charges
  through `aw322xx_chg` on i2c2 address 0x6a. There is no file called
  `aw322xx_charger.c` in any of the trees used for this port, which is where
  this section originally stopped, but `drivers/power/supply/aw32257_charger.c`
  *is* that driver: it matches `compatible = "awinic,aw322xx_chg"` and registers
  the power supply literally named `aw322xx_charger`. It was never loaded.
  With it loaded the kernel reports `battery/status = Charging`. A Linux session
  still should not be left unattended, because of the two risks below.
* **No `/dev/watchdog`.** See §3.
* **The modem and PM co-processor are not brought up.** mu300-linux needs
  Android's `modem_control` in a chroot to disarm the PM watchdog; nothing
  equivalent has been attempted here. Anything that depends on the modem (mobile
  data, and on some Unisoc parts the PM watchdog) is out of scope for now.

## 6. USB gadget

Stock exposes a single UDC, `musb-hdrc.1.auto`, with an Android-shaped gadget
(`ffs.adb`, `sprdgser.gs0/1/2`, `idVendor=0x18d1 idProduct=0x4ee8`).
e5-linux builds its own gadget through configfs from the initramfs: ECM
(`usb0`, the `192.168.77.0/24` management LAN) plus a CDC-ACM console on
`ttyGS0`. `CONFIG_USB_F_ACM`/`CONFIG_USB_F_ECM` and the two `USB_CONFIGFS_*`
options are built in rather than modular so the console does not depend on module
load order; musb itself stays a module and is loaded at its stock position.

Known open issue inherited from the kernel port: the gadget bind-to-enable path
was a few seconds slower than stock, and the four `musb_sprd` fixes
(DMA channel programming, `dr_mode`, the PHY platform-name race, the
`hops.host_start` NULL deref) were compile-verified only.

**VERIFIED** (§7): `/sys/class/udc/musb-hdrc.1.auto/state` reads `configured`,
the host enumerates `0525:a4a1 Linux-USB Ethernet Gadget`, the initramfs udhcpd
hands out `192.168.77.4/24`, and telnet to `192.168.77.1` gives a root shell.

### 6.1 NCM instead of ECM, and a DHCP server that actually runs

The gadget originally spoke CDC-ECM.  macOS does bind it (it shows up as an
Ethernet interface), but nothing served DHCP on a normal boot: the initramfs udhcpd
only runs on the standalone path, and on the switch_root path init just does
ifconfig usb0 up, so the host sat on a 169.254 link-local address forever.  Two
changes:

* the configfs function is now **ncm.usb0** (the kernel already had
  CONFIG_USB_CONFIGFS_NCM=y and CONFIG_USB_F_NCM=y; only the initramfs script named
  ecm.usb0), which is also the protocol macOS handles best.  The CDC-ACM console is
  unchanged, and it is still the channel this work is driven over.
* usb0 is configured by systemd-networkd -- Address=192.168.77.1/24 plus
  DHCPServer=yes, in /etc/systemd/network/10-e5-usb0.network, with NetworkManager
  told to leave the interface alone.  networkd is pulled in by a drop-in on
  NetworkManager.service rather than by enabling it, because the overlay travels
  into the initramfs as plain files and cannot carry symlinks.

Result on hardware: the device reports usb0 UP 192.168.77.1/24 with networkd active
and State: routable (configured), the Mac gets 192.168.77.92 by DHCP, and
ping 192.168.77.1 is 0% loss.  (There is no sshd in the image, so the LAN is ICMP/HTTP
for now; the serial console is still the shell.)

### 6.2 The power key used to power the device off

Symptom: the screen goes dark and pressing power does not bring it back -- and the
device disappears from USB entirely.  Cause: systemd-logind's default
HandlePowerKey=poweroff.  Plasma Mobile drives the key itself, but logind saw it
first, so "wake the screen" was executed as "power off".

/etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/10-e5-power.conf now sets HandlePowerKey,
HandlePowerKeyLongPress, HandleSuspendKey, HandleHibernateKey, HandleLidSwitch and
IdleAction all to ignore -- this port has no usable suspend/resume either, so nothing
should try.  Verified with busctl get-property: HandlePowerKey = "ignore",
IdleAction = "ignore".

### 6.3 Session, keys, and which kernel Image to flash

Three symptoms turned out to be one cause, and one of them was self-inflicted:

* The panel showed the SDDM **greeter** (its theme is what looks like a boot logo)
  instead of Plasma Mobile, and the **power and volume keys did nothing**.  Both are
  the same failure: when the autologin session fails, SDDM falls back to the greeter,
  and in an X11 greeter the keys go nowhere -- they are wired to gpio-keys, not to the
  console.  The kernel does deliver them: /proc/bus/input/devices shows gpio-keys with
  KEY_VOLUMEDOWN (114), KEY_VOLUMEUP (115) and KEY_POWER (116).
* The autologin session was failing because **KWin could not keep /dev/dri/card0**.
  With the Image this work had rebuilt (Homebrew clang 23, plus CONFIG_DEVMEM for a
  watchdog experiment that turned out to be a dead end) the log reads
  "kwin_wayland_drm: failed to open drm device at /dev/dri/card0 / No suitable DRM
  devices have been found", and KWin's clients then abort with
  "no Qt platform plugin could be initialized".

So the boot image now carries the **original Image** again (work/Image, sha256
c1ab1905...) with the new ramdisk: 64 modules, the NCM gadget, and the overlay.  The
same three checks then pass: kwin_wayland + plasmashell run, /sys/kernel/debug/dri/0/state
says allocated by = kwin_wayland, and the keys have a compositor to talk to.
CONFIG_DEVMEM stays in the fragment only because boot/init logs the SoC watchdog
registers; without it that log line is just skipped.

### 6.4 Telnet on the management LAN

The full system had no remote shell (the initramfs telnetd only exists on the
standalone path, and there is no sshd in the image).  The initramfs now copies its
static arm64 busybox into the real root as /usr/local/bin/busybox, and
e5-telnetd.service runs busybox telnetd -p 23 -l /bin/login from it -- no package has
to exist in the Debian image.  The unit is pulled in by the same NetworkManager
drop-in as systemd-networkd (the overlay cannot carry enable symlinks).  Verified from
the host: 192.168.77.1:23 answers with a telnet banner and the host holds a DHCP lease
on 192.168.77.92.

## 7. What actually happened: the boot campaign

Five trial boots on 2026-09-17. Each one flashes `boot_b` plus the 32-byte
`bootloader_control` in `misc`, reboots, and reads the results back either from
Android afterwards or, once the gadget worked, from the running Linux itself.

### 7.1 The kernel boots and the slot mechanism works

Run 1 (slot b, 42 modules) settled it. `uboot_log` shows LK honouring the armed
slot — `boot_b ramdisk read OK, size = 1800450` followed by
`fixup androidboot.slot_suffix=_b` — and the persistent block inside `boot_b`
records our kernel running our init for 276 s:

```
E5-PERSIST-BEGIN uptime=276.28 release=5.15.211-g94401422a7df
1.74 stage=devfs-ready
5.08 stage=modules-done loaded=31 failed=11
5.32 stage=partitions misc=/dev/mmcblk0p3 boot_b=/dev/mmcblk0p37
45.32 stage=udc udc=none available=
45.72 stage=misc-restored-slot-a dev=/dev/mmcblk0p3
45.87 stage=ready standalone
```

The device then rebooted itself back into Android, which means the rollback rule
this project depends on holds on this device: a slot-b boot that never reaches
userspace ends up on slot a.

### 7.2 Two drivers existed but were never loaded

Both failures had the same shape, and neither is visible in the source tree.

**The charger blocked USB.** The first run had no UDC at all, and `dmesg` said
why once the deferral was traced:

```
platform 64a00000.usb: DEFERDBG: supplier 2-006a not ready
probe of 64a00000.usb returned -517
```

`2-006a` is the AW322xx charger. On the live device the USB controller lists it
as a devicetree supplier, because the charger node declares the `vddvbus`
regulator that `musb_sprd` requests when it switches to host mode:

```
$ ls /sys/bus/platform/devices/64a00000.usb/ | grep supplier
supplier:i2c:2-006a -> .../i2c:2-006a--platform:64a00000.usb
```

`fw_devlink` checks suppliers *before* entering a probe function, so while
`2-006a` has no driver the USB controller can never probe — and the only
symptom is an empty `/sys/class/udc`. Loading `aw32257_charger.ko` fixes it
properly. `fw_devlink=permissive` also unblocks it, but it was tried and
rejected: with every driver free to probe out of order the kernel died before
the initramfs wrote its first log line.

**The display was missing its power domain.** `/dev/dri` did not exist and
`/sys/class/drm` contained only `version`, because `sprd_vpu_pw_domain.ko` —
the genpd provider for the VPU/display domain — was never loaded, so
`31000000.dpu`, `31300000.dsi` and `30130000.sprd-gsp` never probed. This is
the same gap `artifacts_e5/diagnostics_2026-09-10.md` works through on the
Android port. Loading it, plus `sprd-gsp.ko` and `sprd-drm.ko`, gives
`/dev/dri/card0` and a `card0-DSI-1` connector.

The lesson generalises: Android's first-stage `modules.load` is not a
description of what the hardware needs, it is a description of what Android's
*second* stage has not loaded yet. Anything the initramfs needs and Android
defers is missing from it, and the failure mode is silent.

### 7.3 The final state

```
Linux e5-linux 5.15.211-g94401422a7df aarch64
1.76 stage=devfs-ready
11.57 stage=modules-done loaded=56 failed=0
11.86 stage=partitions misc=/dev/mmcblk0p3 boot_b=/dev/mmcblk0p37
12.00 stage=udc udc=musb-hdrc.1.auto available=musb-hdrc.1.auto,
12.13 stage=usb-bind-done rc=0
12.58 stage=data-mounted
13.41 stage=rootfs-unavailable err=
13.44 stage=misc-restored-slot-a dev=/dev/mmcblk0p3
13.47 stage=ready standalone
```

All 56 modules load, `/sys/kernel/debug/devices_deferred` is empty (nothing is
waiting on anything), the UDC is `configured`, the device tree is a working
network, and:

```
/ # cat /sys/class/power_supply/battery/status
Charging
/ # cat /sys/class/power_supply/battery/capacity
50
/ # ls /dev/dri
card0
```

Also worth recording because it cost a boot: the initramfs used to locate
`misc`/`boot_b` *after* the module pass. Moving that earlier, so an early crash
still leaves a log, does not work on this platform — the eMMC partitions are not
in `/sys/class/block` yet and the discovery came up empty for twenty seconds.
The authoritative attempt stays after the module pass; the early one is best
effort. `boot/init` now does both.

## 8. Wi-Fi: the driver is in the tree and builds, but nothing ships it

`lsmod` under Linux has no Wi-Fi module and there is no `wlan0` — not because the
hardware has no driver, but because the driver was never put into the initramfs.

The hardware is a Unisoc WCN combo chip (sc2332/sc2355 family); the board's own DT
wires it up over SDIO as `sprd,sc2355-sdio-wifi`. Both halves of the driver are in
the kernel tree e5-linux builds from:

| module | source | config in `e5_rongyue_defconfig` |
|---|---|---|
| `wcn_bsp.ko` | `drivers/unisoc_platform/sprdwcn/` — sprdwcn bus plus the `sdio/sdiohal_*` glue | `CONFIG_UNISOC_WCN_BSP=m` (line 758) |
| `sprd_wlan_combo.ko` | `drivers/unisoc_platform/sprd_wlan_combo/` — fullmac cfg80211 WLAN driver | `CONFIG_UNISOC_WLAN_COMBO=m` (line 762) |

The Kconfig is reachable — `drivers/unisoc_platform/Kconfig` sources both
sub-Kconfigs and `drivers/Kconfig` sources that file — so `make Image modules dtbs`
really does build both `.ko` files, and `CONFIG_CFG80211=m` is present for the
fullmac glue. The `.ko` files are in the kernel build output; they are simply not in
`boot/module-order.txt`, which is the only list `boot/stage-modules.sh` packs into
the initramfs.

That they are second-stage on Android is visible on the running device:

    # ls /vendor/lib/modules | grep -iE "wcn|wlan|cfg80211"
    cfg80211.ko
    sprd_wlan_combo.ko
    wcn_bsp.ko

and a first-stage device check says the rest of the path is intact: the SDIO
controllers inside the SoC (`22200000.sdio`, `22210000.sdio`) *do* defer early on
their PMIC power domain -- `probe of 22210000.sdio returned -517` at 1.33 s, before
any module is loaded -- but by `uptime=14.74`, when the initramfs writes its last log
block, `/sys/kernel/debug/devices_deferred` is empty, so the PMIC driver from the
module pass is what unblocks them. Wi-Fi is missing its driver, not its bus.

**Why they were missing is the same story as section 7.2.** `module-order.stock` is
Android's *first-stage* `modules.load`. Android brings Wi-Fi up from its second stage
(`modprobe`, out of `/vendor/lib/modules`), so the WCN modules are not in that
83-entry list — and because the initramfs uses `insmod` with a fixed order, there is
no modprobe afterwards to pull them in either. The result is a silent gap: the
modules are built, nothing loads them, and the only symptom is that Wi-Fi does not
exist. The charger (`aw32257_charger.ko`, section 7.2) and the display power domain
(`sprd_vpu_pw_domain.ko`) were the same shape of bug.

The fix is two lines in `boot/module-order.extra`:

    wcn_bsp.ko
    sprd_wlan_combo.ko

`boot/gen-module-order.py` resolves the closure, so `cfg80211.ko` is pulled in
automatically and the SDIO/MMC core the bus needs is built in (`CONFIG_MMC=y`,
`CONFIG_MMC_SDHCI=y`). The kernel modules then have to be rebuilt and restaged
(`kernel/build-linux.sh`, `boot/stage-modules.sh`, then the boot image). No `.ko`
files were on the macOS host used for this session, so the entries are in place but
**UNVERIFIED on hardware**.

### 8.1 Loading the modules is necessary, not sufficient

`drivers/unisoc_platform/sprdwcn/boot/wcn_boot.c` and `wcn_integrate_boot.c` take the
WCN core out of reset with `request_firmware()`, so the chip only boots if these are
where the Linux firmware loader looks (`/lib/firmware` in the root filesystem):

    wcnmodem.bin
    gnssmodem.bin
    wifi_board_config*.ini
    connectivity_configure*.ini
    connectivity_calibration*.ini
    tsx_data

and the driver additionally reads factory data from Android paths that have no
Debian equivalent:

    /mnt/vendor/wifimac.txt                              (factory MAC)
    /mnt/vendor/wcn/connectivity_calibration_bak.ini
    /productinfo/wcn/tsx_bt_data.txt
    /data/vendor/wifi/wifimac_temp.txt

Read out of the running Android, these are the files that actually exist on this
device and where they live:

| file | location on Android | note |
|---|---|---|
| `wcnmodem.bin` | `/odm/firmware/wcnmodem.bin` | 947 KiB, the WCN firmware |
| `gnssmodem.bin` | `/odm/firmware/gnssmodem.bin` | 596 KiB, requested during WCN boot too |
| `wifi_board_config*.ini` | `/odm/firmware/` and `/odm/etc/` | `.ini`, `.xpe.ini`, `_aa.ini`, `_aa.xpe.ini` — the board variants all ship |
| `tsx_data` | `/vendor/firmware/tsx_data` | the only `tsx`-ish file on the vendor image |
| factory MAC | `/mnt/vendor/wifimac.txt` | `fc:b5:85:d0:9d:47` on this unit |
| calibration dir | `/mnt/vendor/wcn/` | empty on Android too; the driver *writes* `connectivity_calibration_bak.ini` there, so it has to exist and be writable |

`/odm` is an `erofs` logical partition inside `super` (`/dev/block/dm-0`) and
`/vendor` likewise, so the blobs cannot just be mounted from Linux the way
`userdata` can. They have to be pulled off the device from Android and shipped inside
the `rootfs.ext4` (put them in `/lib/firmware`) — the same reasoning as section 2,
just for firmware rather than the root filesystem. `/mnt/vendor` is different: that is
plain **`/dev/block/mmcblk0p1`, ext4, 5.3 MiB**, so a Linux boot can mount it
read-only at `/mnt/vendor` directly and get `wifimac.txt` (and `btmac.txt`) from the
real partition instead of a copy. The `calinv` partition (`mmcblk0p69`) mounts too,
but it is empty — it is not where the calibration lives.

One thing works in our favour: the same code waits for a filesystem to appear before
giving up ("request_firmware keep waiting for file system ready, the max waiting time
is 80s"), which is why loading the WCN modules from the initramfs — where
`/lib/firmware` does not exist yet — is still workable: the driver retries until the
Debian root filesystem is mounted.

`rootfs/pull-wcn-firmware.sh` does the copy: it stages `/odm/firmware`'s WCN set,
`/vendor/firmware/tsx_data` and the `/mnt/vendor` factory files into
`rootfs/overlay/lib/firmware/` and `rootfs/overlay/mnt/vendor/` (which
`device-finalize.sh` then applies like any other overlay file), skipping paths that
do not exist. They are vendor blobs and stay out of the repository. On this unit
`tsx_data` is skipped: `/vendor/firmware/tsx_data` is a symlink to
`/mnt/vendor/productinfo/wcn/tsx_bt_data.txt` and that target is a dangling link even
under Android, whose Wi-Fi works regardless -- so it is not fatal, but it also cannot
be copied.

### 8.2 Verified on the device

The packaging fix works.  Built from the tree and listed in
boot/module-order.extra, the WCN stack loads on a real boot:

    stage=modules-done loaded=63 failed=0
    sprd_wlan_combo      2510848  0
    cfg80211              888832  1 sprd_wlan_combo
    wcn_bsp               430080  1 sprd_wlan_combo

and the driver probes the chip: marlin_probe: device node name: sprd-marlin3, the DT
supplies (avdd12, avdd33, dcxo18) resolve, and the WCN bus channels come up.  The
firmware is reachable because the initramfs now carries the rootfs overlay and
materialises it *before* the module pass
(stage=overlay-early files=21 firmware=6), so request_firmware() finds wcnmodem.bin
without waiting for the real root filesystem.

### 8.3 The next blocker: the driver reads its firmware from a partition

The chip still does not come up, and this is why.  The WCN base driver takes the
BT/Wi-Fi firmware from a path in the device tree, not from the firmware loader:

    /proc/device-tree/sprd-marlin3/sprd,btwf-file-name  = /dev/block/by-name/wcnmodem
    /proc/device-tree/sprd-marlin3/sprd,gnss-file-name  = /vendor/firmware/gnssmodem.bin

and this device has **no partition named wcnmodem** -- the GPT has no wcn* name at
all.  wcn_boot.c opens that path with filp_open() and reads the firmware out of it,
so the boot ends with the chip being powered back down

    WCN BASEwifipa 3v3 0 ... avdd12 power disable ... marlin chip en pull down
    sprd-wlan: failed to power on WCN!
    probe of sprd-marlin3:wlan returned 19 after 60553796 usecs

i.e. -ENODEV after the driver's 80-second retry window.  (supply dvdd12 not found,
using dummy regulator is benign; the other three supplies resolve.)

The path is what has to be satisfied, and it can be satisfied from userspace: point
/dev/block/by-name/wcnmodem at a loop device backed by the wcnmodem.bin this image
already carries, and provide /vendor/firmware/gnssmodem.bin.  Both belong in the
overlay, which boot/init already knows how to apply.

**Correction (2026-09-18): the partition path is a fallback, and it is not what was
wrong.**  `wcn_boot.c` tries the firmware loader first:

```c
    if (marlin_dev->is_btwf_in_sysfs) {
        err = marlin_download_from_partition();
        return err;
    }
    pr_info("marlin %s from /system/etc/firmware/ start!\\n", __func__);
    err = request_firmware(&firmware, "wcnmodem.bin", NULL);
    if (err < 0) {
        pr_err("no find wcnmodem.bin errno:(%d)(ignore!!)\\n", err);
        marlin_dev->is_btwf_in_sysfs = true;
        err = marlin_download_from_partition();
        return err;
    }
```

`marlin_download_from_partition()` is the `/dev/block/by-name/wcnmodem` path; it only
runs once `request_firmware()` has already failed.  The `from /system/etc/firmware/`
line is a hardcoded string naming a directory that does not exist in this root
filesystem at all, which is what made the log look like a partition read.

On the live system `dmesg` shows

    WCN BASEmarlin btwifi_download_firmware from /system/etc/firmware/ start!
    WCN BASEmarlin btwifi_download_firmware successfully!

with **no** `no find wcnmodem.bin` line anywhere, and

    WCN BASEgnss_download_firmware successfully through request_firmware!

for the GNSS half.  So the real requirement is the one section 8.1 already states --
`wcnmodem.bin` present in `/lib/firmware` -- and the loop device was never necessary.
(Worse than unnecessary, as it turned out: a read-write loop over the file makes
`request_firmware()` fail with `ETXTBSY`; section 29.)
The chip comes up because the initramfs overlay materialises the firmware before the
module pass.

### 8.4 What to look at when it is tried

    dmesg | grep -iE "wcn|wlan|sdio"      # probe, firmware load, chip boot
    lsmod | grep -E "wcn_bsp|sprd_wlan_combo"
    ip link                               # wlan0 should appear
    cat /sys/class/net/wlan0/address      # factory MAC, or random if unset

### 8.5 The chip boots now -- and the driver kills it 20 s later

Everything above was measured before the kernel could boot the chip's *GNSS* half,
which is fatal and silent: the WCN core downloads BT/Wi-Fi firmware first, then
GNSS, and only then comes up.

**The trap: the GNSS half has no filesystem wait.**  `gnss_download_firmware()`
calls `request_firmware("gnssmodem.bin")` **once** and treats `-ENOENT` as a
fallback trigger:

```c
	if (marlin_dev->is_gnss_in_sysfs) {
		err = gnss_download_from_partition();
		return err;
	}
	err = request_firmware(&firmware, "gnssmodem.bin", NULL);
	if (err < 0) {
		pr_err("%s no find gnssmodem.bin err:%d(ignore)\n", __func__, err);
		marlin_dev->is_gnss_in_sysfs = true;      /* sticky, for the whole boot */
		err = gnss_download_from_partition();
```

`gnss_download_from_partition()` reads the DT's `sprd,gnss-file-name`
(`/vendor/firmware/gnssmodem.bin`), which does not exist in this rootfs, so it
returns NULL -- and the `is_gnss_in_sysfs` flag stays set, so every later retry
skips the firmware loader entirely.  Measured (modules loading from the
initramfs, where `/lib/firmware` does not exist yet):

    [15.621] gnss_download_firmware start from /system/etc/firmware/
    [15.629] (NULL device *): Direct firmware load for gnssmodem.bin failed with error -2
    [15.655] gnss_download_from_partition gnss buff is NULL
    [25.823] GNSS download timeout
    [38.4  ] marlin chip en pull down ... sprd-wlan: failed to power on WCN!
    [38.4  ] probe of sprd-marlin3:wlan returned 19 after 12534326 usecs

The BT/Wi-Fi half does not have this problem because
`marlin_download_from_partition()`/`btwifi_download_firmware()` waits up to 80 s
for a filesystem ("keep waiting for file system ready"), which is why Wi-Fi used
to come up in some sessions and GNSS never did.  The fix is the one
`rootfs/pull-wcn-firmware.sh` was written for: the firmware has to be in the
initramfs's *early* overlay, not just in the root filesystem, so that
`/lib/firmware` exists before the module pass (`boot/init` materialises
`e5-overlay/lib/` first).  With `wcnmodem.bin`, `gnssmodem.bin` and
`wifi_board_config*.ini` in `rootfs/overlay/lib/firmware/`:

    [1.766] E5-LINUX: stage=overlay-early files=45 firmware=6
    [13.907] gnss_download_firmware successfully through request_firmware!
    [16.516] marlin btwifi_download_firmware successfully!
    [17.214] sprd-wlan: sprd_wlan_probe sprd,sc2355-sdio-wifi 2.
    [17.343] sprd-wlan: sprd_iface_set_power Power on WCN (0 time)

and `phy0` + `wlan0` + `p2p-dev-wlan0` appear, with both rfkill switches
unblocked.  Bluetooth gets further too: `sprdbt_tty.ko` (in
`boot/module-order.extra`, it was never in the stock first-stage list either)
brings up `/dev/ttyBT0` plus a bt rfkill, and `btattach -B /dev/ttyBT0 -S
3000000` does create `hci0` (`Bus: UART`) -- bluez is installed and
`bluetooth.service` is already running.

**The blocker: the driver's own hang detector dumps the card.**  20 seconds
after the chip comes up, `loopcheck` (an `AT+loopcheck` ping the driver runs to
detect a stuck WCN core) decides the chip is dead and sets the SDIO card's dump
flag, after which **every** power-on is refused:

    [28.574] WCN BASE: start_loopcheck
    [30.6]   rx:loopcheck_ack:ap_send=30591,cp2_bootup=28055,cp2_send=30613   <- chip answers
    [34.758] WCN SDIO: carddump flag set[1]
    [38.507] WCN BASEstop_marlin SDIO card dump
    [38.627] WCN BASEstart_marlin [MARLIN_WIFI] ... start_marlin SDIO card dump
    [62.661] WCN BASEstart_marlin [MARLIN_BLUETOOTH] ... start_marlin SDIO card dump

`start_marlin()` (wcn_boot.c) refuses when `get_loopcheck_status() >= 2`, so the
symptoms downstream are exactly what was reported -- Wi-Fi present but every
scan `-EIO` with `sc2355_send_cmd_recv_rsp CP2 assert` (`hif->cp_asserted` is set
by the reset notifier the dump triggers), and Bluetooth's `mtty_open power on
state ret = -1!` / `sprdwcn_bus_push_list failed: -19`:

    $ sudo iw dev wlan0 scan
    command failed: Input/output error (-5)
    $ sudo hciconfig -a
    hci0: Type: Primary  Bus: UART   BD Address: 00:00:00:00:00:00   DOWN INIT RUNNING

That is the state to pick up from: the chip is alive and both transports exist,
so what is left is either to work out why `loopcheck` trips (its first round
succeeds, the later ones apparently do not -- `loopcheck.o` in `wcn_bsp`, and
`get_loopcheck_status()` at `boot/wcn_integrate_boot.c:3596`) or to stop it from
condemning a working card (`sdiohal_main.c:762`,
`sdiohal_set_carddump_status()`).

Two smaller facts worth keeping: the vendor's board-level WCN set for this exact
board (UM9621_1h10) is in `connconfig/marlin3_lite/ums9621_1h10/` -- and it
contains `bt_configure_pskey*.ini`, `bt_configure_rf*.ini` and
`fm_board_config*.ini`, which the *device* does not carry (the earlier pull only
took `wifi_board_config*.ini` and the two MACs; nothing in the kernel reads the
`bt_configure_*` files, so they are for a userspace BT HAL rather than for
`btattach`).  And `wcn_wifi_driver.conf`, whose absence fills a line in dmesg,
is optional tuning: `sprd_parse_wifi_driver_config()` returns silently when the
file is missing.

### 8.6 Solved: the driver was built as the "userdebug" variant

The card dump in 8.5 is not a hang.  It is a compile-time policy, and this
repository was building the wrong one.

Android's Kbuild picks part of this driver's behaviour from its build variant:

    ifeq ($(TARGET_BUILD_VARIANT),user)
    ccflags-y += -DFLAG_WCN_USER
    endif

and a hand-run `make` sets no `TARGET_BUILD_VARIANT`, so `FLAG_WCN_USER` was
never defined and the driver took every `#else` branch.  One of them is the
assert policy:

```c
#ifdef FLAG_WCN_USER
	atomic_set(&sysfs_info.is_reset, 0x1);      /* WCN_ASSERT_ONLY_RESET */
#else
	atomic_set(&sysfs_info.is_reset, 0x0);      /* WCN_ASSERT_ONLY_DUMP  */
#endif
```

`__wcn_assert_interface()` reads that value and then either dumps the chip's
memory and leaves the SDIO card dead, or resets the chip and carries on.  Since
the loopcheck treats one missed `at+loopcheck` round (4 s to answer) as an
assert, the userdebug default turns a single late answer into a radio that is
dead for the rest of the boot.  The same `#ifdef` also adds a reset-pad priority
write for qogirl6 in `btwf_sys_poweron()` -- the user variant is not just the
policy.

It is settable at runtime, which is how it was pinned down: the whole
difference is one sysfs write.

    $ cat /sys/class/misc/wcn/devices/reset_dump          # dump   (before)
    $ echo reset > /sys/class/misc/wcn/devices/reset_dump # switch to the user policy
    $ echo manual_dump > /sys/class/misc/wcn/devices/reset_dump   # force an assert
    WCN SDIO: carddump flag set[0]            <- cleared
    WCN BASE: wcn_reset_process reset end     <- chip reset, no dump
    $ sudo iw dev wlan0 scan | grep -c SSID:
    18

so the radio came back inside an already-booted device, and `reset_dump`'s
three accepted values (`dump`, `reset`, `reset_dump`) are exactly the three
policies of the `if`/`else` chain above.

The fix is the vendor's own production switch, brought out as a Kconfig symbol so
that the choice is visible and lives in `kernel/e5-linux.fragment` rather than in
a Makefile:

    CONFIG_UNISOC_WCN_BSP_USER_VARIANT=y

Verified on a freshly flashed boot with no sysfs writes of any kind:
`reset_dump` reports `reset`, the loopcheck answers every round, no
`carddump flag set` line appears at all, and Wi-Fi scans 18 APs on both bands on
its own.  Bluetooth gets one step further with it too -- the chip answers the
whole HCI init sequence and `hci0` comes up with a real BD address
(`27:93:31:14:22:11`) and sane ACL/SCO MTUs, where before the policy change its
power-on returned -1.

**What that leaves is a second, unrelated failure**, which the carddump flag had
been hiding the whole time: 8.7.


### 8.7 Bluetooth: one rejected HCI command was all of it

With the carddump trap out of the way the controller initialized completely and
then refused to be powered on, and btmon says why:

    < HCI Command: Write Default Link Policy Settings (0x02|0x000f) plen 2
            Link policy: 0x000f   (Role Switch + Hold + Sniff + Park)
    > HCI Event: Command Complete
          Status: Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12)
    Can't init device hci0: Invalid argument (22)

45 commands and their events had crossed `/dev/ttyBT0` before it.  The value comes
from the LMP features the controller itself reported (`lmp_hold_capable()` and
friends) and the command is only sent because `hdev->commands[5] & 0x10` claims
support, so this firmware advertises hold/sniff/park and then refuses to enable
them.  `hci_req_cmd_complete()` turns that status into a request error -- and the
request is the one that brings the controller up, so a controller that answers
`0x12` here can never be powered on, with the controller sitting there fully
initialized.  (Correction, 2026-09-26: Android sends it too -- the btsnoop log of
its BT start has `0x080f` answered with status 0x12 -- and Gabeldorsche simply does
not treat that answer as fatal.)

`kernel/patches/0008` (`3bd2464a8`) makes that one command non-fatal: it warns
(`Bluetooth: hci0: controller rejected the default link policy (0x12)`) and clears
the status, which is exactly how `hci_cc_write_def_link_policy()` already treats
a rejection.  With it, `hciconfig hci0 up` succeeds, bluez reports
`Controller 27:93:31:14:22:11` with `Powered: yes`, and an inquiry lists nearby
devices.

`rootfs/overlay/etc/systemd/system/e5-bt-attach.service` keeps it that way.  It
has to be btattach rather than nothing at all because *opening* `/dev/ttyBT0` is
what powers MARLIN_BLUETOOTH on (`mtty_open` -> `start_marlin`), and the tty has
to stay open for the controller to exist.  The unit is deliberately not ordered
against `bluetooth.service`: bluetoothd hot-plugs the adapter whenever it appears,
and a wedged BT core must not be able to hold up the boot (section 9 is what that
costs).  systemd wants a `*.wants/` *link* to consider a unit enabled, and neither
`boot/build-boot-image.py` nor the overlay staging loop in `boot/init` can carry a
symlink, so `boot/init` makes that one link while it materialises the overlay.

Two things are still open on Bluetooth, and neither is a blocker:

* the BD address is the chip's own default (`27:93:31:14:22:11`), not the factory
  one in `/mnt/vendor/btmac.txt`.  Android's BT HAL writes it with a vendor
  command; bluez 5.82 no longer has `hciconfig hci0 bdaddr` and the kernel's
  `HCISETBDADDR` ioctl is gone as well, so setting it means a small tool driving
  the vendor command, or accepting an address that is stable but wrong (a peer
  that paired with the Android BT stack will not recognise this device).
* pairing and a data transfer have not been exercised -- an inquiry only proves
  the radio, the stack and the HCI transport work.  The one attempt so far (the
  settings app at 14:26, to the peer bluez has in its cache as "Enceka SE",
  `80:04:5F:76:78:0C`) came back
  `org.bluez.Error.ConnectionAttemptFailed: Page Timeout`: the page went out and
  the peer never answered it.  That is what a peer that is off, out of range or
  refusing connections looks like, and it is not evidence either way about
  paging itself -- nothing has been connected successfully yet.

## 9. The five-minute reset: the PMIC watchdog, not a panic

**Solved.** A Linux session used to die about five minutes in, silently, and it looked
like a panic.  It never was one: the bootloader arms the *PMIC* watchdog as well as the
SoC one, and the driver that feeds it was built but never staged into the initramfs.

Measured on the device with the host doing *nothing at all* -- no serial console
opened, no adb, no reads -- using only the bootloader log:

    LK hands over to Linux      21:21:27
    LK runs again (the reset)   21:26:22       295 s

and the reset leaves no console output, no pstore record and is classified by LK as a
reset (ANA_REG_GLB_POR_OFF_FLAG:0x0).  With nobody reading the serial port a real panic
would look identical, which is why this stayed a mystery.

The answer is in the PMIC watchdog driver's own probe message, once it is loaded:

    [   13.489569] calling  init_module+0x0/0xfe8 [sprd_pmic_wdt]
    [   13.490350] sprd pmic wdt:pmic_timeout 300,feed 250
    [   13.501574] probe of 64400000.spi:pmic@0:watchdog@40 returned 0

pmic_timeout 300 -- a 300 second timeout, matching the ~295 s observed -- and Android
binds that same driver to that same device
(64400000.spi:pmic@0:watchdog@40 under /sys/bus/platform/drivers/sprd-pmic-wdt), which
is why Android survives an armed PMIC watchdog and Linux did not.  Our initramfs had
sprd_pmic_wdt.ko built (out_linux/drivers/watchdog/sprd_pmic_wdt.ko) but never listed
in boot/module-order.txt, so nothing ever loaded it and nothing fed the watchdog LK
had armed.

The fix is that one entry in boot/module-order.extra, and the result is visible
directly:

    before:  session dead at 295 s, every boot
    after:   uptime 10 min and still running, Plasma Mobile up (load average ~8)

### 9.1 What it was not

* **Not a panic or an oops.**  Nothing reaches ttyGS0 (a kernel console), pstore stays
  empty, and LK reports a reset rather than a power-off.
* **Not the harness or this session's tooling.**  The 295 s figure came from a boot
  with the host doing nothing; the 300 s cap on a host tool call only kills the shell
  on the *host*.
* **Not the initramfs safety timer.**  It sleeps 600 s and is stopped before
  switch_root (a session records stage=switch-root-jobs-killed persist=189 timer=190);
  firing would log stage=timer-reboot first.
* **Not the SoC watchdog driver.**  sprd_wdt_fiq does probe (641e0000.watchdog), but
  reading its registers through /dev/mem shows CTRL = 0x4 -- the counter-enable bit is
  clear, so it was never counting -- and disarming it explicitly changed nothing: the
  session still died at 295 s.  boot/init now only *logs* those registers, as a
  diagnostic, and CONFIG_DEVMEM=y (kernel/e5-linux.fragment) stays for that.
* **Not the PMIC monitor register LK prints.**  ANA_REG_GLB_WDG_RST_MONITOR reads 0x0
  after the reset; that register tracks a different watchdog state than the PMIC
  watchdog driver's own timeout.

## 10. Building the kernel on macOS with clang

The kernel does build on a macOS arm64 host with Homebrew's LLVM, and the result is
loadable on the device: the modules built this way carry the same vermagic as the
ones in the running kernel
(5.15.211-g94401422a7df SMP preempt mod_unload modversions aarch64) and the same
module_layout CRC (0x78fb914d), which is what makes "build the modules only, keep the
flashed kernel" work.

What macOS lacks is the Linux tooling *around* the compiler.  Each gap is a host-side
workaround; the kernel tree is never modified, so setlocalversion still yields
5.15.211-g94401422a7df (no -dirty suffix):

| gap | workaround |
|---|---|
| /usr/bin/make is GNU 3.81, the build wants 3.82+ | brew install make -> work/bin/make -> gmake 4.4 |
| BSD sed -i and cp -T in merge_config.sh | brew install gnu-sed coreutils, their gnubin dirs first in PATH |
| no <elf.h> | glibc's elf.h in work/hostinc/ (this tree's modpost has its own ELF parser and needs only the header) |
| no <asm/types.h> for host tools (Linux hosts get it from linux-libc-dev) | work/hostinc/asm/* -> symlinks to the kernel's include/uapi/asm-generic/* |
| Darwin declares uuid_t (sys/unistd.h -> sys/_types/_uuid_t.h, used by gethostuuid.h) which collides with the uuid_t in scripts/mod/file2alias.c | both SDK headers stubbed in work/hostinc/ |
| no depmod (kmod is Linux-only) | boot/gen-modules-dep.py: depmod's rule, derived from Module.symvers plus each module's undefined symbols; boot/stage-modules.sh uses it when depmod is missing |

The last one reproduces depmod's answer rather than approximating it -- both find
sprd-drm.ko -> ocp2131.ko, sprd-gsp.ko, and the WCN entry comes out as
sprd_wlan_combo.ko -> wcn_bsp.ko, sipc-core.ko, cfg80211.ko.  CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO and
DEBUG_INFO_BTF are already off in kernel/e5-linux.fragment (so no pahole is needed)
and arm64 needs no objtool.  The exact environment is recorded in work/build6.sh;
a full Image + modules build takes about twenty minutes on an M-series host with -j8.


## 11. What the phone session costs, and what to run instead

Measured on the device (`free -m`, `ps -eo rss,pcpu,comm`), Plasma Mobile 6.3.6 on
llvmpipe with 36 running user units:

| | total | used | free | buff/cache | available | zram |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| before | 1450 | 1288 | 93 | 387 | 162 | 719 / 767 used |
| after trimming | 1450 | 926 | 354 | 394 | 524 | 590 / 767 used |

The single largest item was not the shell.  `plasma-settings` -- the phone settings
app -- was running as an XDG autostart unit
(`app-org.kde.mobile.plasmasettings@....service`) and held **356 MB**.  Behind it:
plasmashell 228, maliit-keyboard 93, kwin_wayland 62, kded6 45, xwaylandvideobridge
40, powerdevil 38, Discover's notifier 36, kdeconnectd 36, xdg-desktop-portal 36, the
polkit agent 34, kactivitymanagerd 33, gmenudbusmenuproxy 32, xembedsniproxy 32,
ksmserver 32.  (RSS double-counts shared Qt libraries, but the ranking is what
matters.)  zram was 94 % full, so the session was also paying compression CPU for
every page fault -- which is the real symptom: not the number, the thrashing.

What was turned off (live, and therefore already inside the rootfs image, whose
loop file is the persistent root):

| change | how |
|---|---|
| settings app, Discover notifier, KDE Connect | `home/e5/.config/autostart/*.desktop` with `Hidden=true`, carried in the overlay so it survives a re-image |
| gmenudbusmenuproxy, xembedsniproxy, xwaylandvideobridge, kaccess | `systemctl --user mask` -- X11-only helpers on a Wayland phone; the instance already running was killed by pid |

That is ~360 MB released, and more usefully `available` 162 -> 524 MB.  What is left
is the shell itself: plasmashell 254 MB and kwin_wayland 87 MB, with plasmashell at
39 % CPU.  On llvmpipe every Qt Quick frame is rasterised on the CPU, and no Mesa
driver exists for this GPU; the DRM work in section 8 is unrelated to that (the panel
is a plain DSI framebuffer driven through DRM planes).

Lighter shells, all present in trixie for arm64 (checked against
packages.debian.org/trixie/arm64):

| option | shape | note |
|---|---|---|
| Phosh (`phosh`, `phoc`, `squeekboard`) | GTK4 shell + wlroots compositor | the phone stack Debian itself ships for mobile; no KDE/Qt daemon fleet, and phoc can run with `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` |
| Sxmo (`sxmo-utils`) | sway + dmenu-style menus and gestures | smallest sensible phone UX, but a menu-first interaction that has to be learned |
| sway + `wvkbd` + `waybar` | hand-rolled | ~120-200 MB and full control, at the cost of assembling the UX |
| cage / labwc / weston | kiosk or bare wlroots | single-app or bare desktop; useful as a cheap renderer test |
| LXQt (`lxqt-session`) | Qt desktop | lighter than Plasma, but not a touch UI |

The renderer matters more than the shell on this board: every wlroots compositor
(phoc, sway, labwc, cage) runs without GL under `WLR_RENDERER=pixman`, so a
GTK4/wlroots stack is the natural next step -- which is why `docs/STATUS.md` keeps
Plasma Mobile as the fallback rather than the target.

Getting there: the device has no route off itself except the USB LAN, the host does.
For a handful of packages, fetch the arm64 `.deb`s on the host and `dpkg -i` them on
the device (it is aarch64, so the unpack and the maintainer scripts are native).  For
a stack like Phosh (100+ packages) let apt resolve instead: run a small HTTP proxy on
the host, point the device at it with `Acquire::http::Proxy` in
`/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/`, and the dependency walk stays on the device where it is
correct.

zram itself was 768 MB of lzo-rle and 94 % full.  It is now 4 GiB of zstd
(`E5_ZRAM_SIZE` / `E5_ZRAM_COMP` in `rootfs/overlay/usr/local/sbin/e5-zram`), with
`vm.swappiness=100` and `vm.page-cluster=0`
(`rootfs/overlay/etc/sysctl.d/10-e5-zram.conf`): swapping earlier costs less than
letting the anonymous set grow until the session has to reclaim synchronously, and one
page at a time is the cheap case for a random-access device.  4 GiB is an overcommit on
a 1.45 GiB machine and that is fine -- only the *compressed* pages occupy RAM, so what
matters is the ratio (zstd has lz4/zstd selected as active: `[zstd]` in
`/sys/block/zram0/comp_algorithm`), not the nominal size.

## 12. The 9-key keypad: a driver that was never staged

The board is a 5G feature phone, so most of its input is a numeric keypad plus a
back key, not the touch panel.  The keypad is a plain matrix keypad on the SoC's AON
keypad controller, and it is in the running device tree:

    /proc/device-tree/soc/aon/keypad@641B0000
      compatible = "sprd,sc9860-keypad", status = "okay"
      keypad,num-rows / keypad,num-columns / debounce-interval / linux,keymap

and the platform device exists (`641b0000.keypad`).  Nothing was bound to it, and
nothing said so: no dmesg line, no failed probe, no input device.  `waiting_for_supplier`
on the device is stale -- the AON clock gate it waits for probed normally
(`ums9621-clk 64900000.aonapb-gate: clock probe`, and the consumer devlink
`platform:64900000.aonapb-gate--platform:641b0000.keypad` is there).  The reason is the
same one that hid the charger, the display power domain and the WCN drivers:

    CONFIG_KEYBOARD_SPRD=m

and `sprd_keypad.ko` is not in Android's first-stage module list, so neither the
initramfs nor the Debian root filesystem ever loads it.  An unbound platform device is
invisible; loading the driver is what makes it appear.

The fix is two modules, built from the same tree and configuration as the flashed
kernel (section 10's `LLVM=1` invocation, `make M=drivers/input/keyboard modules`),
plus its dependency:

| module | config | why |
|---|---|---|
| `sprd_keypad.ko` | `CONFIG_KEYBOARD_SPRD=m` | the matrix keypad driver |
| `matrix-keymap.ko` | `CONFIG_INPUT_MATRIXKMAP=m` | `depends=matrix-keymap`, parses `linux,keymap` |

`vermagic=5.15.211-g94401422a7df SMP preempt mod_unload modversions aarch64` and the
module CRCs match the flashed kernel, so no kernel change and no reflash are needed.
After `insmod` on the running system, /proc/bus/input/devices goes from two devices to
three:

    N: Name="sprd-keypad"   H: Handlers=kbd event2   B: KEY=...ffc (KEY_1..KEY_9, KEY_0, * #)

The two devices that were already there are worth restating: `gpio-keys` (input0) holds
**the power and volume keys** -- its KEY bitmap decodes to KEY_VOLUMEDOWN, KEY_VOLUMEUP
and KEY_POWER -- and `tlsc6x_touch` is input1.  So the physical keys were always
generating events; what was missing was (a) the keypad driver and (b) anything in the
session that acts on KEY_POWER, which logind was told to ignore (section 6.2).

Persistence is in two places:

* the running rootfs -- `matrix-keymap.ko` and `sprd_keypad.ko` under
  `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/input/`, `depmod -a`, and
  `/etc/modules-load.d/e5-keypad.conf`, so systemd's modules-load stage insmods them
  early on every boot (verified: both listed in `lsmod` after
  `systemctl restart systemd-modules-load`);
* the boot image -- both names are in `boot/module-order.extra`, and
  `boot/stage-modules.sh` picks up every `.ko` in `out_linux`, so a rebuilt
  `boot-linux-slotb.img` carries 66 modules instead of 64 and loads them in
  dependency order (`matrix-keymap.ko` before `sprd_keypad.ko`).

### 12.1 The confirm key is KEY_SELECT: what it broke, and the remap that fixes it

The keypad's devicetree keymap (`/proc/device-tree/soc/aon/keypad@641B0000/linux,keymap`,
20 entries of `(row << 24) | (col << 16) | keycode`) decodes to:

| row,col | keycode | name |
|---|---|---|
| 1,0 | 0x161 (353) | **KEY_SELECT** -- the confirm key |
| 0,0 | 0x9e (158) | KEY_BACK |
| 0,4 | 0x20b (523) | KEY_PHONE |
| 0,5 / 0,6 / 1,1 / 1,2 | 0x6a / 0x67 / 0x69 / 0x6c | RIGHT / UP / LEFT / DOWN |
| 3,0 / 3,1 | 0x8b / 0xa9 | KEY_MENU / KEY_NEXT |
| 3,3..3,5, 1,3..1,6, 0,1..0,3 | 2..11 | KEY_1 .. KEY_0 |
| 3,6 | 0x37 | KEY_KPASTERISK |

Nothing in the session handles KEY_SELECT, so on the phosh lock screen the PIN could be
typed but never submitted.  What the lock screen does want was measured by injecting
keys with `tools/key-inject.py`, on a locked session:

    tools/key-inject.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 enter     -> LockedHint stays yes
    tools/key-inject.py 1 2 3 4 5 6 kpenter   -> LockedHint: no    (unlocked)

phosh's lock screen unlocks on **KP_Enter**, not on Return, and the PIN is checked by
PAM -- a wrong one leaves `phosh[..]: pam_unix(phosh:auth): authentication failure`
in the journal (that is how the "123" typed by an earlier test showed up).

The fix is the ordinary one -- a udev/hwdb key remap, applied by udev's `keyboard`
builtin at device-add time, so it is in the kernel's scancode table and costs no
latency at all:

The keypad table also exposes the physical # key at matrix scancode 0x04. The image now declares `KEYBOARD_KEY_4=numericpound` explicitly so the dialer receives a stable numeric-pound key instead of relying on the raw numeric code.

    # rootfs/overlay/etc/udev/hwdb.d/61-e5-keypad.hwdb
    evdev:input:b0000v0000p0000e0000*
     KEYBOARD_KEY_8=kpenter

The subtlety is the *scancode*: it is the matrix scan code, not the keycode the key
produces.  The keypad is a 4x7 matrix, so `row_shift = 3` and the confirm key
(row 1, col 0) is `(1 << 3) | 0 = 8`.  evdev's `EVIOCSKEYCODE` indexes
`input_dev->keycode[]`, whose size is `rows * cols = 28`; an index of 353 (the
keycode) is out of range and comes back `EINVAL` -- which is exactly the mistake that
made an earlier version of this section claim the device "cannot be remapped at all".
It can, and `tools/keycode-query.py` shows it (`--from`/`--to`-style read and write,
with `INPUT_KEYMAP_BY_INDEX`):

    tools/keycode-query.py /dev/input/event2 0x0 0x8 0x9
      0x000 -> 158 (BACK)
      0x008 -> 353 (SELECT)      <- the confirm key
      0x009 -> 105 (LEFT)
    tools/keycode-query.py /dev/input/event2 0x8=96
      set 0x008 -> 96 (KP_ENTER)
    # after udevadm hwdb --test / systemd-hwdb update / udevadm trigger:
      0x008 -> 96 (KP_ENTER)

`systemd-hwdb-update.service` (WantedBy=sysinit.target) recompiles
`/etc/udev/hwdb.bin` at boot when the file is newer, so this survives without an
explicit `systemd-hwdb update`.  A userspace uinput re-emitter was the working plan
before this; it is not needed, and it would have added a process and a second
keyboard device to the session.

**Why the key had to change at all** is worth looking at, because it is not obvious
from the phone: phosh 0.46's lock screen has **no unlock key**.  Its on-screen keypad
is 3x4 with the bottom row `[OSK toggle] [0] [backspace]`, and the lock screen itself
opens on the clock and has to be swiped (or tapped) before the keypad appears:

    lock screen (355x533 at scale 0.9)          after a swipe
    "10:35  Friday, September 18"               "Enter Passcode" + dots + 1..9 0 [keypad] [<-]

So for someone typing on the *physical* keypad there was nothing to press: the PIN
could be typed and never submitted, which is exactly the report ("the confirm key
cannot confirm, the back key cannot go back, there is no unlock button").  With
`KP_ENTER` the confirm key submits, and that is confirmed working on the device.

The back key (scan code 0) was briefly remapped to `BackSpace` with hwdb and then
reverted, because `KEY_BACK` is what the session uses for "back" -- but a keypad-only
phone also has no delete key, so `kernel/patches/0004` makes the *driver* report
BackSpace next to KEY_BACK for that one key.  One key, both jobs, and nothing in
userspace: entries ignore KEY_BACK, navigation ignores BackSpace.  The capability is
visible in the device's key bitmap once the patched module is loaded:

    /proc/bus/input/devices, sprd-keypad:  BACKSPACE(14) yes  KP_ENTER(96) yes  BACK(158) yes

The hwdb rule therefore still carries only `KEYBOARD_KEY_8=kpenter`.  So the two
keys of this section are implemented in two different layers: the confirm key is a
**userspace** udev/hwdb remap of a matrix scan code, the back key is a **kernel**
change in `drivers/input/keyboard/sprd_keypad.c` (committed as `678d2409`, see
section 20.2 for the table of kernel commits).

## 13. Baseband internet: Android's modem_control in a chroot

The vendor kernel already carries the whole SIPC/SIPA modem stack: the modules are
loaded (`sipc_core`, `sipa_core`, `sipa_eth`, `sipa_usb`, `sprd_modem_loader`, `sipx`,
`spool`, `spipe`, `unisoc_mailbox`, `trusty_log`, ...), the char devices exist --
`/dev/modem` is char 481 and the AT channels are `/dev/stty_nr0..31`, char 489, as
`/proc/devices` confirms -- and `/sys/class/` has `sipa`, `sipa_eth`, `sprd-sipc`,
`sprd-sipx`, `ext_modem`.  Every one of those channels still fails with ENODEV,
because that is only the *transport*: the CP (baseband) firmware has never been
started.

### Who has to start it, and why it is Android's job

`sprd_modem_loader` (`drivers/unisoc_platform/modem/modem_loader/sprd_modem_loader.c`)
is a char device with `MODEM_START`/`MODEM_STOP`/`MODEM_GET_LOAD_INFO`/... ioctls, and
its ioctl path compares the *calling task's name*:

    if (strcmp(current->comm, modem->rd_lock_name) != 0) { ... return -EPERM; }

so the loader only serves a task literally called `modem_control`.  That is Android's
`/vendor/bin/modem_control`, and it needs more than the binary: bionic (it is an
Android ELF), the property area (it reads `ro.vendor.radio.modemtype` to learn the
modem configuration) and `libkernelbootcp.trusty.so` (it reloads `pm_sys` and the
modem through the Trusty `kernelbootcp` TA).  The E5 therefore gets the same
treatment as the MU300 port: extract the Android vendor subset and run
`modem_control` in a chroot.

### Getting the subset out of a production Android

`rootfs/extract-android-vendor.sh` does it, and the trick is that the E5's Android is
a *production* build: `ro.build.type=user`, `ro.debuggable=0`, no `su` anywhere in
PATH and `adb root` answers "adbd cannot run as root in production builds".  What
saves it is Magisk -- `/debug_ramdisk/su -c id` returns `uid=0(root)` -- which is
what the flashing scripts have been using all along.

49 MiB comes out: `/apex/com.android.runtime` (linker64 + bionic), `/system/lib64`,
`/vendor/bin/{modem_control,cp_diskserver,refnotify}` with their vendor libs, the
`/vendor/etc/modem_*.xml` files `modem_control` parses, `vendor/etc/ueventd.rc`, and
the one thing no partition has: the *live* `/dev/__properties__` area (1.4 MiB of
tmpfs that Android's init builds at boot).

### Four requirements, each discovered by failure

| symptom | cause | fix |
|---|---|---|
| `modem_ctrl_int_modem_type: ro.vendor.radio.modemtype not_find`, then `can't get modem type!`, and nothing else happens | the subset was unpacked from a tarball built on macOS, so `property_info` was owned by uid 501.  bionic's `PropertyInfoAreaFile::LoadPath()` returns false unless `st_uid == 0 && st_gid == 0`, and one false there leaves the *entire* property system uninitialised -- `getprop` then prints nothing at all | `chown -R root:root` in `vendor-start.sh` |
| `modem_control` sleeps in a nanosleep loop and never opens a device | liblog retries `connect(/dev/socket/logdw)` forever; there is no logd on Linux | `logdw.py`: a 40-line Python `SOCK_DGRAM` sink bound at `/dev/socket/logdw` |
| the modem loader still refuses | `modem_control` drops to uid `system` (1000), while devtmpfs hands every node over as `root:root` 0660, and `/dev/block/by-name` does not exist at all | `node-perms.sh` applies Android's own `/vendor/etc/ueventd.rc` (path, mode, user, group) to the nodes that exist, and the by-name links are rebuilt from each partition's `PARTNAME` |
| nothing boots even so | the driver checks the task name | `exec chroot .../android /vendor/bin/modem_control` -- directly, never through `linker64` -- with a bind-mounted copy of `/proc/cmdline` whose `androidboot.slot_suffix` is forced to `_a` (LK passes `_b` for the trial slot, and the `_a` images are the ones Android itself uses) |

With those in place the modem log (through the logdw sink) goes `Modem Alive` /
`CH Alive`, dmesg prints `modem modem@0: modem_control modem run = 1!`, and
`/dev/stty_nr1` stops returning ENODEV and starts blocking on read, which is what an
AT channel is supposed to do.

### The data path: AT on /dev/stty_nr1, data on sipa_eth0

`rootfs/overlay/opt/e5/mobile-data` implements up/down/status/watch/sim-reset with
nothing but shell and the AT channel:

    AT+SFUN=2                        SIM on
    AT+SFUN=4                        protocol stack on;  +CFUN: 0 becomes +CFUN: 1
    AT+CEREG?                        +CEREG: 2,1,"5104","059FA02D",7   (LTE registered)
    AT+COPS?                         46001 (China Unicom), CSQ 52
    AT+CGDCONT=1,"IPV4V6","3gnet"   APN from /etc/e5/mobile-data.conf
    AT+CGACT=1,1                     activate the default bearer
    AT+CGCONTRDP=1                   3gnet.MNC006.MCC460.GPRS,
                                     10.105.136.142/255.0.0.0,
                                     DNS 58.240.57.33 and 221.6.4.66
    AT+CGDATA="M-ETHER",1            -> CONNECT: the bearer lands on sipa_eth0

then `ip link set sipa_eth0 up`, `ip addr add <address>/<prefix from the mask>`
(`sipa_eth0` is raw IP and NOARP), `ip route replace default dev sipa_eth0`, and
`/etc/resolv.conf` gets the two DNS servers (`resolvectl` is not installed on this
image).

Verified on the device: `busybox wget http://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/trixie/Release`
returns the real index (`Origin: Debian`, `Suite: stable`, `Version: 13.7`) with the
USB LAN having no route to the internet -- the traffic left through the baseband.  The
carrier also assigns a `2408:893a:...` IPv6 address; there is no IPv6 default route
configured yet.

Three units carry it: `e5-vendor.service` (`Before=sysinit.target`, runs
`vendor-start.sh`, and `ConditionPathExists=/opt/e5/android/vendor/bin/modem_control`
so a fresh image without the proprietary subset still boots), `e5-mobile-data.service`
(oneshot, `mobile-data up`) and `e5-mobile-data-watch.service` (`mobile-data watch`,
which rebuilds the bearer when a modem reset drops it).  Checked across a reboot:
all three `active`, `sipa_eth0` UP with a fresh address, wget works.

The subset is proprietary and is not in this repository (`work/` is gitignored);
`rootfs/extract-android-vendor.sh` reproduces it from the device, and the overlay
carries everything else.

## 14. 5G NR: what the device does, and what the network is not offering

The modem is the NR variant, and that is visible in three independent places:
`modem_control` logs `modem type is nr` and loads `nr_modem`/`nr_phy`/`nr_fixnv`/
`nr_runtimenv`; Android's property area (which we copy) carries
`ro.vendor.radio.modemtype=nr`; and `AT+SPRAT?` answers `+SPRAT: LTE 16` -- the
camped RAT, not the capability.  That command is read-only on every AT channel this
image exposes (`AT+SPRAT=<n>` is always `+CME ERROR: 4`), and
`NSACFG`/`SNRCFG`/`SBAND`/`MODE`/`SYSMODE`/`E5GOPT`/`WS46` do not exist at all, so
nothing user-space can flip the RAT over AT.

> **The conclusion in the sentence above is wrong**, and so is the "no AT-side
> switch" half of the paragraph that closes this section: the switch is
> `AT+SPLBAND`, a command that search never tried.  Corrected in 14.1 below.

The same SIM in the same spot on Android (fully booted, China Unicom 46001, LTE band 1,
RSRP -90):

    gsm.network.type=LTE,Unknown
    getRilDataRadioTechnology=14(LTE)
    mCellInfo=[CellInfoLte{... mEarfcn=100 mBands=[1] ...}, CellInfoLte{...}, CellInfoLte{...}]
    CellSignalStrengthLte ... CellConfigLte :{ isEndcAvailable = false }

No `CellInfoNr` anywhere, and `isEndcAvailable=false`: at that location the network
offers neither NR SA nor EN-DC, so there is nothing for the modem to camp on.  Android's
own configuration is 5G-ready (`ro.telephony.default_network=26`, i.e.
NR_LTE_TDSCDMA_GSM, and `persist.radio.is_vonr_enabled_0=true`), which is the point: the
Linux side is not missing a switch that would light up 5G here.

What *was* wrong on the Linux side is which slot's modem images get loaded.
`modem_control` takes the slot from the bootloader's slot suffix, and LK spells it
`sprdboot.slot_suffix=_b` -- not `androidboot.slot_suffix`, which is what the MU300
recipe rewrites.  A slot-b Linux trial therefore booted slot b's firmware and NV
(`nr_phy_b`, `nr_fixnv1_b`, `nr_deltanv_b`).  Android runs from slot a, and slot a is
where its RIL configured the modem, so `vendor-start.sh` now rewrites the suffix to `_a`
and, belt and braces, points the `_b` device names at the `_a` partitions.
`/etc/e5/modem-slot` containing `current` opts out.  Whatever Android achieves with NR
(its RIL writes modem NV through `cp_diskserver`) is then the configuration Linux boots
with.

To re-check after the network or the SIM changes, on either system:

* Linux: `mobile-data status` prints `+CEREG: ...` with the AcT decoded --
  `LTE`, `NR (5G SA)` (11) or `LTE+NR (EN-DC/NSA)` (13) -- plus the raw `+SPRAT?`.
* Android: `getprop gsm.network.type` and
  `dumpsys telephony.registry | grep -E 'CellInfoNr|accessNetworkTechnology'`.

### Confirmed: NR SA runs on the Linux side

After the user restarted the baseband from Android and locked it to band n78, Android
reported:

    gsm.network.type=NR_SA
    accessNetworkTechnology=NR
    CellInfoNr ... mRegistered=YES mCellConnectionStatus=1
                 mNrArfcn=627264 mBands=[78] mNrFrequencyRange=3 ssRsrp=-100
    gsm.version.baseband=5G_MODEM_V2_23B_W24.16.1_P1|ums9621_modem
    persist.vendor.modem.nr.enable=1

and after rebooting into Linux the same modem -- booting the slot-a images and NV, per
the remap above -- camped the same way with no further configuration:

    +CEREG: 2,1,"DE0400","005BE001",11      AcT 11 = NR SA
    +COPS: 0,2,"46001",11                    China Unicom, NR
    +SPRAT: LTE 32                            (the numeric field moved 16 -> 32
                                               together with the camped RAT; the name
                                               token stays "LTE", so do not trust it)
    sipa_eth0 UP 10.131.171.189/8             bearer built on the NR link
    busybox wget http://mirror.nju.edu.cn/... 9.6 MB in 1.5 s (~50 Mbit/s)

So the RAT preference lives in the modem NV, written there by Android's RIL, and the
Linux port inherits it as long as it boots slot a's modem firmware and NV.  There is no
AT-side switch to set it (and none is missing): `mobile-data status` now decodes the AcT
so the camped RAT is visible at a glance -- `LTE`, `NR (5G SA)` or `LTE+NR (EN-DC)`.

### 14.1 The old "no AT-side RAT switch" note, corrected

The last two sentences above are half wrong, and one search is to blame.  The search was
for `AT+SPRAT=<n>`, `NSACFG`, `SNRCFG`, `SBAND`, `MODE`, `SYSMODE`, `E5GOPT` and `WS46`;
all of those really do fail (`AT+SPRAT=<n>` is `+CME ERROR: 4`, the rest do not exist),
and from that the conclusion "nothing user-space can flip the RAT over AT" was drawn.
The commands that do exist were simply never tried:

    AT+SPLBAND=0                        -> +SPLBAND: <49-64>,<33-48>,<17-32>,<1-16>,<65-80>
    AT+SPLBAND=1,0,256,0,5,0            -> OK          (LTE: bands 1, 3 and 41)
    AT+SPLBAND=3                        -> +SPLBAND: <v1>,<0>,<v3>,<super>
    AT+SPLBAND=2,1,0,256,4              -> OK          (NR: n1, n78, n80)
    AT+SPLBAND=1,0,0,0,0,0              -> OK          (LTE: no band lock)
    AT+SPLBAND=2,0,0,0,0                -> OK          (NR: no band lock)
    AT+SPFORCEFRQ=16,6,627264,5         -> OK          (lock to one NR cell)
    AT+SPFORCEFRQ=12,3                  -> +SPFORCEFRQ: 12,3,<freq>,<pci>

`AT+SPLBAND` is the band lock: one bit per band inside its 16-band group on LTE, and
three tables (`value1`, `value3`, and the "super" bands n75/76/80-84/86) on NR.
`AT+SPFORCEFRQ` is the cell lock, with 12 = LTE and 16 = NR as its RAT selector -- the
627264 in the example is the n78 ARFCN from the NR SA measurement above.  The same source
settled the neighbours that were also missing here: 5G SA/NSA is
`AT+SP5GRAN?`/`AT+SP5GRAN=<0|1>`, 5G registration is `AT+C5GREG?`, VoLTE is `AT+CAVIMS?`,
and the UE usage setting is `AT+CEUS`/`AT+CEMODE`.

What was right above, and still is: the RAT the modem *camps* on at boot comes from modem
NV written by Android's RIL, so booting slot a's images is what decides it, and
`persist.vendor.modem.nr.enable` remains a property, not a switch.  A band lock is an
additional constraint on top of that, not a replacement for it.

Provenance, stated plainly: these shapes came out of researching the modem's own AT
surface, not from vendor documentation and not from this handset.  **They have not been
sent to the handset yet**, so treat them as the shape to try first rather than as measured
behaviour.  Whoever tries them should read the lock back after writing it, because "the
modem accepted the command" and "the lock took" are two different claims.

## 15. Sharing the baseband with the USB LAN (NAT), and why apt uses http

`mobile-data up` now also forwards: `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` plus an nftables table
(`e5_nat`) with `oifname sipa_eth0 masquerade` and the usual MSS clamp -- this image has
nftables, not iptables, and it had to be installed.

Installing it is where the mirror came in.  The device reaches the internet only through
its own bearer now, and the official `deb.debian.org` index is ~15 MB: apt worked but
crawled, and any **https** fetch hangs (`openssl s_client` to :443 times out at every
MTU from 1500 down to 1200, while :80 is fine), so the sources are the Nanjing
University mirror over **http** (`rootfs/overlay/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.sources`)
-- 8 MB/s, which is what made the Phosh install take a minute instead of an hour.

Verification without a second machine: a network namespace with a veth pair
(`10.99.0.2` -> `10.99.0.1` on the E5) exercises forwarding *and* masquerade, because
that source address is not local to the E5.  `busybox wget` from inside the namespace
returns the real Debian `Release` file, so a USB client behind `usb0` gets the same
treatment.  (`ip netns` + `veth` both work in this kernel.)

## 16. Phosh replaces Plasma Mobile as the session

    apt-get install phosh phoc phosh-osk-stub squeekboard foot
    # phosh 0.46.0-3+deb13u1, phoc 0.46.0-1, phosh-osk-stub 0.46.0-1

Phosh's compositor is wlroots, so `/etc/environment` gained `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` --
phoc then never touches GL, which is the point on this board.  SDDM still autologins
`e5`; the session is now `phosh.desktop` and `plasma-mobile.desktop` is untouched, so
switching back is one line.

Three traps, all of them silent:

1. SDDM reads `/etc/sddm.conf` and *then* `/etc/sddm.conf.d/*`, but a value present in
   both is not simply overridden by the drop-in: editing `sddm.conf.d/10-e5.conf` alone
   kept the old session.  The authoritative place turned out to be the main
   `/etc/sddm.conf`.
2. `/var/lib/sddm/state.conf` remembers the *last* session and wins over the
   configuration for autologin (`Session=/usr/share/wayland-sessions/plasma-mobile.desktop`).
   Both files have to agree.
3. Restarting `sddm` does not stop the old session's processes: the Plasma session kept
   running (kscreenlocker_g 173 MB, plasmashell 108 MB, kwin_wayland, kded6, ...)
   alongside phoc.  Only a reboot cleared them -- and the reboot is what proved the
   configuration, so it was the right move anyway.

Measured, same device, same panel, `free -m`:

| session | used | available | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plasma Mobile, after the section 11 trim | 926 | 524 | kwin + plasmashell on llvmpipe |
| Phosh | 723 | 727 | phoc + phosh + phosh-osk-stub, `plasmashell` 0 |

About 200 MB more headroom, and neither session needed the other's daemons: the KDE
helpers stay masked (they are X11-only), and the 240 MB `plasma-settings` process that
showed up in `ps` was phosh launching it *on demand* (its scope says "Application
launched by phosh"), not an autostart leftover -- `systemctl --user unmask` after
checking, so the on-screen Settings button keeps working.

## 17. Removing KDE, and the trap that made the 4 GiB zram keep coming back

With Phosh working, the KDE/Plasma stack was purged (`~n^plasma`, `^kwin`, `^kde`,
`^libkf`, `^kf6`, `^kscreen`, `^maliit`, `^breeze`, `^powerdevil`, `^kactivity`,
`^polkit-kde`, `^ksmserver`, `^systemsettings`, `^kglobalaccel`, `^kio`, then
`apt-get autoremove --purge`).  `/` went from 4.6 GiB used (962 MiB free) to **4.0 GiB
used / 1.6 GiB free**, `plasmashell` is gone, and `/usr/share/wayland-sessions/` now
holds exactly `phosh.desktop`.

Measured on the same rootfs, same panel, `free -m`, three minutes after boot:

| session | used | available | zram used | biggest process |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plasma Mobile as found | 1288 | 162 | 719 MB | plasma-settings 356 MB |
| Plasma Mobile, after the section 11 trim | 926 | 524 | 590 MB | plasmashell 254 MB |
| Plasma Mobile, second measurement (section 16, before the purge) | 1032 | 418 | 120 MB | plasmashell 368 MB / 56 % CPU |
| Phosh, before the purge | 732 | 718 | 1 MB | phosh 75 MB, phoc 19 % CPU |
| **Phosh, KDE purged** | **707** | **743** | 6.5 MB | phosh 71 MB, phoc 10.5 % CPU |

So Phosh costs about 325 MB less than the same-rootfs Plasma Mobile, and its
compositor burns about half the CPU (both are software-rendered: `WLR_RENDERER=pixman`
for phoc, llvmpipe for kwin).

### The trap: the initramfs overlay is copied over the rootfs on *every* boot

The 4 GiB zram kept reverting to 768 MB after each reboot, and the reason is structural:
`boot-linux-slotb.img` carries a 25-file overlay that `boot/init` copies into `/newroot`
on every boot, and `/usr/local/sbin/e5-zram` is one of those files.  Editing the rootfs
copy therefore lasts exactly until the next boot -- and the same is true of every path
the overlay mentions (`etc/environment`, `etc/sddm.conf.d/*`, `etc/systemd/system/*`,
the firmware files, ...).  Two ways out, and both are used here:

* put the setting somewhere the overlay does *not* mention -- the zram size now lives in
  `/etc/systemd/system/e5-zram.service.d/10-e5-4g.conf` (a drop-in directory, not a file
  in the overlay), which sets `E5_ZRAM_SIZE=4G` and resets zram0 to zstd before the
  stock script runs;
* or reflash the rebuilt image, which is what `boot-linux-slotb.img` (66 modules, 26
  overlay files including all of the above) is for.

### The power button

Two independent pieces are in play, and only one of them was wrong:

* logind must not touch the key, or the device powers off the moment it is pressed --
  `HandlePowerKey=ignore` / `HandlePowerKeyLongPress=ignore` were already in place
  (section 6.2);
* `gnome-settings-daemon`'s `power-button-action` was `suspend`, and this device has no
  working suspend, so pressing the key did nothing visible.  It is now `nothing`, which
  leaves the key to phosh itself (short press locks/unlocks, long press opens the power
  menu).  Confirming that with a real press is the one open item.

## 18. The power key: the kernel was fine, the session was not

Pressing every key on the device while both `gpio-keys` (event0) and the keypad
(event2) were being logged shows the whole input path works:

| evidence | value |
|---|---|
| `gpio-49` ("Power Key") level samples | 9 of 380 at `lo` -- i.e. it really changes |
| `gpio-52` ("Volume Up Key") | 3 samples at `hi` (idle `lo`) |
| `gpio-191` ("Volume Down Key") | 4 samples at `lo` |
| events on event0 | `KEY_POWER` (116) 12x, `KEY_VOLUMEDOWN` (114) 6x, `KEY_VOLUMEUP` (115) 8x, `KEY_F1` (59) 6x |

and `/sys/kernel/debug/gpio` shows the lines claimed by the driver with interrupts
(`gpio-49 | Power Key | in hi IRQ ACTIVE LOW`, `gpio-52 | Volume Up Key | in lo IRQ`,
`gpio-191 | Volume Down Key | in hi IRQ ACTIVE LOW`), all four marked `wakeup-source` in
the DT.

### Why nothing happened anyway

1. logind must ignore the key, or a press powers the device off -- `HandlePowerKey=ignore`
   (section 6.2).
2. phosh does not act on `KEY_POWER` itself.
3. `gnome-settings-daemon`'s `power-button-action` was `suspend`, and **suspend does not
   work on this board**: `rtcwake -m mem -s 15` returns 0, but the kernel log shows
   `sipa 25220000.sipa: thread prepare suspend err` on every attempt -- the modem's data
   path refuses to suspend, so the PM core aborts and resumes immediately.
4. With gsd set to `nothing` instead (to stop the failing suspends) *nobody* handled the
   key -- which is the state the user found: gsd's 300 s idle blank had turned the panel
   off (`bl_power=4`) and no key could turn it back on.

### What runs now: logind alone, no userspace daemon

`/opt/e5/powerkey.py` is gone (2026-09-18).  It listened on `/dev/input/event0`, forced
`idle-delay` to 0 so that its own `bl_power` toggle stayed coherent, and opened the
Power Off dialog on a 1.5 s hold.  All of that was either redundant or actively fighting
the compositor:

* waking from a blanked panel never needed help.  phoc uses wlroots' idle protocol and
  owns DPMS through the DRM connector: once it blanked, `bl_power` alone could not
  bring the CRTC back, and any input event -- key or touch -- unblanks it.  The script
  was writing `bl_power` underneath a compositor that was already doing it;
* `idle-delay=0` was the price of that arrangement, and it is a bad price on a phone:
  it means the panel *never* blanks on its own;
* logind implements the long press in the kernel-facing path already
  (`HandlePowerKeyLongPress`, whose default is `ignore` -- that default, not a missing
  handler, is what made a held key do nothing).

So the key is now logind's, via
`rootfs/overlay/etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/20-e5-pwrkey.conf`:

| press | action | who |
|---|---|---|
| short | `lock` -- phosh's lock screen | systemd-logind |
| long | `poweroff` -- immediate, no dialog | systemd-logind's own long-press timer |
| (panel dark) | any key or touch wakes it | phoc (wlroots idle) |

`HandlePowerKey=suspend` is not an option on this board and neither is gsd's
`power-button-action=suspend` (bullet 3 above); `lock` is what is left that is both
instant and safe.

### Verification (measured on the device)

**A real short press locks, and phosh then blanks the panel itself** -- the press does
*not* just sit there waiting for the idle timer.  One press, logged at 1 Hz (the panel
had been blanked by idle beforehand):

| t | `LockedHint` (logind) | `card0-DSI-1/dpms` | `sprd_backlight/bl_power` | what happened |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11:22:26 | no | Off | 4 | idle blank: panel off, session *not* locked |
| 11:22:27 | no | **On** | 4 -> 0 | press wakes the panel |
| 11:22:31 | **yes** | **Off** | **4** | logind locks; the lock screen blanks the panel |
| 11:22:34 | yes | **On** | 0 | a tap wakes it, straight to the lock screen |

`org.gnome.ScreenSaver.ActiveChanged` fires on the session bus at the same moment as
`LockedHint` flips, so the dark screen after a press *is* the locked state, not a
missing one.  `sm.puri.phosh.lockscreen require-unlock=true`, so getting back in needs
the unlock gesture on the lock screen.

**Idle blanking alone does not lock.**  With `idle-delay` at 15 s and the session left
alone:

| t | `LockedHint` | `dpms` | `bl_power` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 s ... 20 s | no | On | 0 |
| 25 s ... 50 s | **no** | **Off** | **4** |
| after one injected `KEY_WAKEUP` | no | **On** | **0** |

The compositor's idle blank is a DPMS blank and nothing else: the session stays
unlocked behind a dark panel, so the only thing that locks this device is the power key.
`idle-delay` is back at 300 s afterwards.

That is not a phosh default we can flip: `org.gnome.desktop.screensaver` already has
`lock-enabled=true` (set here while testing), `idle-activation-enabled=true` and
`lock-delay=0`, and the session still does not lock on idle.  The piece that is missing
is the idle *activator*: GNOME does that in gsd-screensaver, which this gnome-settings-daemon
does not ship and the phosh session does not start (the running plugins are a11y-settings,
color, datetime, housekeeping, keyboard, media-keys, power, print-notifications, rfkill,
**screensaver-proxy**, sharing, smartcard, sound, usb-protection, wacom, wwan).  Locking
on idle would therefore need something that reacts to the idle transition -- an autostart
helper, i.e. the kind of process this section just removed -- or logind's
`IdleAction=lock`, which needs the session to report an idle hint and phoc does not
(`IdleHint` stayed `no` through every blank above).

The long press is also no longer the "Power Off" dialog with its countdown and Cancel
(that came from `gnome-session-quit --power-off`, i.e. from the script).  It powers off
at once.

The long press is also no longer the "Power Off" dialog with its countdown and Cancel
(that came from `gnome-session-quit --power-off`, i.e. from the script).  It powers off
at once.

## 19. Phosh needs GNOME apps -- purging KDE took the only settings app with it

Phosh ships no applications of its own beyond the shell, the OSK and the compositor, so
after the KDE purge the app grid held little more than a terminal: the only "Settings" on
the device had been KDE's `plasma-settings`, and it went with the rest of Plasma.

The phone-shaped set that belongs with Phosh was installed with `--no-install-recommends`
(`/` went to 4.4 GiB used, 1.2 GiB free):

| package | what it is |
|---|---|
| `phosh-mobile-settings` | Phosh's own phone settings (`mobi.phosh.MobileSettings`) |
| `gnome-control-center` | the general GNOME settings app (`org.gnome.Settings`) |
| `gnome-calculator`, `gnome-clocks`, `gnome-characters` | the usual small GNOME apps |
| `foot` | terminal (already there) |

Deliberately **not** installed, with reasons worth writing down:

* `gnome-calls` / `chatty` (calls and SMS) need ModemManager and a RIL on top of the
  modem.  This port drives the modem directly over AT (`docs` sections 13/14); there is
  no RIL, so a dialer would have nothing to talk to.
* `epiphany-browser` (WebKit) and `nautilus` are the obvious next apps when there is
  space and appetite; the baseband gives them a working network, unlike Wi-Fi
  (section 8, still blocked).
* anything that plays audio is questionable until the amplifier path is verified -- the
  MU300 port found its AW883xx silent on I2C, and this board has not been checked.

### Default passwords

`e5` / **123456** and `root` / `root` (`e5` has NOPASSWD sudo).  The user password is
numeric on purpose: the 9-key keypad is the only keyboard on the device and it types
digits, so that is what unlocks phosh's lock screen.  The root one is unchanged, and
`rootfs/device-finalize.sh` -- which creates both accounts when a rootfs is built -- now
writes 123456 as well, so a rebuilt image matches the running device.  Verified by
logging in over telnet as `e5`/`123456`.

## 20. GPU: the UMD/kbase handshake, the panel console, and what still blocks a compositor

Everything in this section was measured on the device on 2026-09-18, on the kernel
this repository builds (`5.15.211-g94401422a7df #4`, 66 modules).

### 20.1 The handshake: ARM's glibc UMD and kbase r41p0 do talk

The kernel side was never in doubt (vendor kbase is built in and reports
`Kernel DDK version r41p0-01eac0`, `GPU identified as 0x1 arch 9.0.9 r0p1`).
What was unknown is whether a *userspace* Mali driver exists that this kernel
accepts.  One does: CoreELEC's `opengl-meson` packages ARM's Linux UMD, and the
r41p0 arm64 build is `r41p0-fbdev-g57-aarch64-8a6d38656-b5` -- glibc, aarch64,
Valhall G57, and built against the same kbase major version this kernel reports.

Installed in the rootfs at `/opt/mali` (`libMali.so` plus
`libEGL.so.1`/`libGLESv2.so.2`/`libGLESv1_CM.so.1` symlinks) and driven by
`tools/egl-probe.py` -- ctypes only, so the target needs no compiler:

    libEGL   : /opt/mali/libEGL.so.1
    eglGetDisplay(DEFAULT) -> 0xfe4aa80
    eglInitialize -> OK, EGL 1.4
    EGL_VENDOR      : ARM
    EGL_VERSION     : 1.4 Valhall-"r41p0-fbdev-g57-aarch64-8a6d38656-b5"
    EGL_CLIENT_APIS : OpenGL_ES
    eglChooseConfig(pbuffer) -> 5 config(s)
    eglCreateContext -> 0x100765a0
    pbuffer surface + current -> OK
    GL_VENDOR                   : ARM
    GL_RENDERER                 : Mali-G57
    GL_VERSION                  : OpenGL ES 3.2 v1.r41p0-fbdev-g57-aarch64-8a6d38656-b5.fc0fdda618d58b1ff293a1730bc57b91
    GL_SHADING_LANGUAGE_VERSION : OpenGL ES GLSL ES 3.20
    GL_NUM_EXTENSIONS           : 101
    glClear + glFinish -> OK

kbase says the same thing from its own side -- the first UMD context makes it
power the GPU up through its platform hook:

    [  136.577129] mali GPU_set_DVFS_table kbase_platform_set_DVFS_table
                   gpu_power_state = 1 gpu_clock_state = 1,gpu_temperature = 39840

Two details worth keeping:

* **This does not need `/dev/fb0`.**  The extension list contains
  `EGL_KHR_surfaceless_context`, and the handshake succeeds on a kernel with no
  fbdev at all -- the "handshake needs fbdev" assumption was wrong.
* **The UMD is not installed as the system `libEGL.so.1`.**  It is a *fbdev*
  build: it has no `EGL_KHR_platform_gbm`/`EGL_MESA_platform_gbm`, so a wlroots
  compositor (phoc) could not use it, and swapping Mesa's libEGL out for it would
  cost the session its renderer for nothing.

### 20.2 `/dev/fb0` needed two driver patches, and it was worth it for the console

The vendor KMS driver in `drivers/unisoc_platform/sprd_disp` never called
`drm_fbdev_generic_setup()`, so `CONFIG_DRM_FBDEV_EMULATION=y` on its own produces
no framebuffer.  `kernel/patches/0001` adds the call at the end of
`sprd_drm_bind()`.  That alone is not enough either, and the reason is a probe
order: the MIPI panel is a *child* device of the DSI host, and it attaches after
`drm_dev_register()`:

    [   11.836695] [drm] sprd_dsi_connector_detect()          <- before the panel exists
    [   11.850052] [drm:sprd_panel_probe] create cabc Succeed!
    [   11.930868] [drm] sprd_dsi_host_attach()
    ...
    [   12.428273] WCN BASEcrystal ... (12 s later, boot continues)

`sprd_dsi_connector_detect()` returns connected only when `dsi->panel` is set, so
the fbdev client probed a "disconnected" connector and gave up.  Patch `0002`
schedules a `drm_kms_helper_hotplug_event()` from a delayed workqueue in
`sprd_dsi_host_attach()` -- from a workqueue, not inline, because the hotplug ends
in a modeset that walks the same panel/DSI paths the probe is still holding.  The
inline version was tried first and made the boot take minutes (the initramfs loads
`sprd-drm.ko`), which is how that was learned.

**These patches live in two places on purpose.**  `kernel/patches/*.patch` in this
repository is the canonical form -- `kernel/build-linux.sh` applies them to a fresh
clone -- and the same four changes are now also *commits* in the kernel tree itself
(`kernel_sprd_ums9158`, branch `linux-staging`):

| patch | commit | what it touches |
|---|---|---|
| `0001-sprd-drm-fbdev-emulation` | `c7b95f5f` | `sprd_drm.c`: `drm_fbdev_generic_setup()` |
| `0002-sprd-dsi-hotplug-on-panel-attach` | `4ab5ac3d` | `sprd_dsi.c/.h`: deferred client re-probe |
| `0003-ion-for-the-fbdev-umd` | `7b42f508` | `staging/android` Kconfig + Makefile |
| `0004-sprd-keypad-backspace-next-to-back` | `678d2409` | `sprd_keypad.c`: back + BackSpace |

The build script recognises the committed state (`git apply --reverse --check` passes,
so it prints "already applied") and the working tree is byte-identical before and after
those commits.  `.scmversion` stays frozen at `-g94401422a7df`, so the release string
-- and with it `/lib/modules/5.15.211-g94401422a7df` -- does not move when the tree
gains commits.

With both DRM patches `/dev/fb0` is there on every boot (`0 sprddrmfb`,
320x480, 32bpp XRGB8888) -- and so is a **console on the panel**.  That second
part needed one more fix: LK merges the boot image's command line with its own
bootargs and *its* parameters win on duplicate keys, so the `console=tty0
loglevel=7` that `build-boot-image.py` has always put in the header never took
effect.  `/proc/consoles` showed only `ttyS1` and `ramoops-1`, the VT never
received a printk, and the panel showed an empty console with a blinking cursor.
The kernel now carries it itself:

    CONFIG_CMDLINE="console=tty0 loglevel=6"
    CONFIG_CMDLINE_EXTEND=y

which is appended after the bootloader's string, and after that:

    ttyS1                -W- (EC    )  235:1
    ramoops-1            -W- (E  p a)
    tty0                 -WU (E  p  )    4:1

The kernel log now scrolls on the panel from the moment fbcon binds.

### 20.3 A window surface still fails, with or without ION

`tools/fbdev-info.py` (new, same ctypes trick) shows what the UMD sees:

    /dev/fb0   smem_start 0x0   smem_len 614400   line_length 1280
               xres x yres 320 x 480   virtual 320 x 480   32bpp
               red/green/blue 16:8 / 8:8 / 0:8   capabilities 0x0

`eglCreateWindowSurface()` with ARM's `fbdev_window {u16 width, height}` fails:

    eglCreateWindowSurface(fbdev 320x480) -> EGL_NO_SURFACE
    FAIL: glCreateWindowSurface failed (EGL_BAD_ALLOC (0x3003))

-- at 320x480 and at 64x64, 160x160, 240x240 and 320x320 (so it is not a size or
a format mismatch), and both before and after ION was enabled.  The blob's
strings contain `/dev/ion` and `query ion heap failed ret=%#x`, i.e. it predates
dma-buf heaps; this kernel has dma-heap but the Android build never enables the
vendor ION that is still sitting in the tree, so `kernel/patches/0003` wires its
Kconfig/Makefile back up and the fragment sets `CONFIG_ION`+`CONFIG_ION_SYSTEM_HEAP`
+`CONFIG_ION_CMA_HEAP`.  `/dev/ion` now exists and the window surface still fails,
so ION was not the (only) blocker and the fbdev path was not pursued further --
it cannot serve a compositor anyway.

### 20.4 A newer UMD is rejected by this kernel

CoreELEC's newer package (`opengl-meson-r44p0`) has exactly the variant that is
missing: `valhall/r44p0/wayland/libMali_g57_dmaheap.so`,
`r44p0-wayland-drm-g57-dmaheap-aarch64`, glibc, linking
`libwayland-client/server` and using GBM.  Run as the session user with the
running phoc's socket:

    libEGL   : /opt/mali/libMali-r44p0-wayland.so
    eglGetDisplay(DEFAULT) -> 0x26da97e0
    FAIL: eglInitialize failed (EGL_NOT_INITIALIZED (0x3001)) -- the UMD did not accept kbase

So kbase r41p0 refuses an r44p0 UMD.  The version check is not advisory: a UMD
from a different DDK major version cannot be used against this kernel, which
rules out "just take CoreELEC's newest blob".

### 20.5 What that leaves

A GPU-composited session needs a **glibc aarch64 GBM (or wayland) UMD built
against kbase r41p0**.  The alternatives, in order of effort:

1. Find that blob.  The r41p0 arm64 package publishes fbdev only, so this means
   another vendor's BSP (Amlogic/Unisoc/Rockchip trees that ship a Linux libmali),
   an ARM DDK build, or a CoreELEC/LibreELEC tree that built the wayland variant
   for an r41p0 kernel.
2. Port the kernel side to the DDK version that *is* published (r44p0) -- a
   kbase replacement plus the vendor platform integration (DVFS, power domains),
   which is a real kernel port, not a config change.
3. libhybris around the device's own Android blob (bionic + the graphics
   allocator/mapper HIDL services) -- how Ubuntu Touch and Sailfish do it.
4. Panfrost, which turned out to need a driver backport rather than a DT port --
   done since, see section 20.7.

### 20.6 The compositor runs on the GPU: an *older* GBM UMD, and a 0600 dma-heap

The missing piece in 20.1-20.5 was a glibc GBM/wayland UMD.  It does not have to be
r41p0: the version check is not what the kernel enforces -- the UMD is the one that
bails out, and only when the kernel is *older* than it.  Allwinner's A523 (also a
G57) userspace, taken from TrimUI Smart Pro S firmware, is one blob with the whole
GBM API in it:

    /opt/mali/libMali-r32p0-sunxi.so
    49,377,264 B, ELF aarch64, glibc
    version string: 1.4 Valhall-"r32p0-01eac1"
    exports gbm_create_device / gbm_bo_create / gbm_surface_create[_with_modifiers]
    EGL client extensions: EGL_EXT_platform_base EGL_KHR_platform_gbm

Against this kernel it initialises on the *compositor* platform rather than the
fbdev one:

    gbm_create_device(/dev/dri/card0) -> 0x4dc1490
    eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT(EGL_PLATFORM_GBM_KHR) -> 0x4f965a0
    eglInitialize -> OK, EGL 1.4
    EGL_VERSION : 1.4 Valhall-"r32p0-01eac1"
    GL_RENDERER : Mali-G57
    GL_VERSION  : OpenGL ES 3.2 v1.r32p0-01eac1.3634895aa082dda7c3407d9f3e199919

(`tools/egl-probe.py` grew an `EGL_PLATFORM=gbm` mode for this; the platform
entry point is only reachable through `eglGetProcAddress` -- it is not a dynamic
symbol in this build.)

`gbm_surface_create(..., SCANOUT|RENDERING)` returns NULL, but the modifier-aware
entry point works, and that is the one wlroots uses:

    gbm_surface_create_with_modifiers(XR24, LINEAR) -> 0x4d61530
    eglCreateWindowSurface(gbm surface) -> 0xac62130
    eglSwapBuffers -> ok (three times)
    gbm_surface_lock_front_buffer -> 0xac62740   stride=1280 format=0x34325258

Then phoc, with the dynamic loader pointed at the blob **for the compositor only**:

    /lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1 --library-path /opt/mali/gbm:/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu \
        /usr/bin/phoc.orig -v -S -C /etc/phosh/phoc.ini ...

...failed at first, and the reason is worth remembering:

    [render/egl.c:205] Supported EGL client extensions: ... EGL_KHR_platform_gbm
    [render/egl.c:555] Failed to create GBM device
    [render/pixman/renderer.c:328] Creating pixman renderer
    phoc[7208]: open /dev/dma_heap/system failed

**`/dev/dma_heap/*` is created 0600 root:root.**  The session user cannot open it,
ARM's GBM allocates its buffers from a dma-buf heap, `gbm_create_device()` returns
NULL, and wlroots quietly falls back to the CPU renderer instead of failing.  One
udev rule later (`rootfs/overlay/etc/udev/rules.d/60-e5-dma-heap.rules`,
`SUBSYSTEM=="dma_heap", MODE="0666"`) the same boot reports:

    [render/egl.c:354] Using EGL 1.4
    [render/egl.c:359] EGL vendor: ARM
    [render/gles2/renderer.c:538] Creating GLES2 renderer
    [render/gles2/renderer.c:539] Using OpenGL ES 3.2 v1.r32p0-01eac1...
    [render/gles2/renderer.c:541] GL renderer: Mali-G57

with the GPU actually busy (`SPRDDEBUG gpu core power on polling SUCCESS`), the
shell up ("Phosh ready after 0.85s"), and `grim` capturing the composited output.

Two details keep the rest of the session working:

* the blob has **no Wayland platform** in its EGL client extensions, so GTK apps
  must keep Mesa's software EGL.  That is why phoc gets the blob through an
  explicit `--library-path` on the loader rather than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, which
  its session child (`gnome-session`) would inherit;
* `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` from `/etc/environment` is unset for phoc by the same
  wrapper, so wlroots gets to choose its GLES2 renderer.

All of it is installed by `rootfs/overlay/opt/e5/gpu-mali-setup`: the
`/opt/mali/gbm/*` symlinks, the `/usr/bin/phoc` wrapper (the real binary stays as
`/usr/bin/phoc.orig`), and the chmod that makes the current boot work before udev's
rule is in place.

### 20.7 Panfrost on the device: what it took, and what runs now

Sections 20.1-20.6 are the search for a blob this kernel accepts.  This is the
other route, and it is the one that works: panfrost drives the Mali-G57, the
compositor renders on it, and -- for the first time on this device -- so do the
clients.  Everything below was measured on the device, image `bf347253`,
kernel `97082a76`.

**The driver was not there.**  The tree's `drivers/gpu/drm/panfrost` is upstream
v5.15 with a couple of ACK backports and stops at Bifrost -- its model table ends
at `GPU_MODEL(g31, 0x7003)` and there is no `hw_features_g57` -- so upstream
6.0's job-manager Valhall series was carried back: `2e87309e0660`,
`382435709516`, `a17775a1af59`, `0c0af438345e`, `892e7fb7c254`, `5b9afc161ea5`,
`d8e53d8a4e0a`, `5ba99fca1de0`, `952cd9745092`.  That is the G57 model entry
(its ARM codename is "Natt", which is also what the vendor DT calls the node),
its feature and issue sets, three errata bits and the two register writes that go
with them.

**The platform side was nobody's.**  There is no power domain for this GPU in
the device tree, and the sequence that switches it on lived only in kbase's
platform code.  What makes it portable is that the DT already carries every one
of those registers as an opaque `<&syscon REG MASK>` triple, so a driver needs
the *order*, not the addresses: `panfrost_sprd.c` is
`mali_kbase_config_qogirn6l.c`'s `mali_freq_init()` plus
`mali_power_on()`/`mali_clock_on()` with the DVFS governance dropped.  First
boot with it:

    panfrost 23140000.gpu: clock rate = 26000000
    panfrost 23140000.gpu: Unisoc GPU powered on (DVFS index 3)
    panfrost 23140000.gpu: mali-g57 id 0x9091 major 0x0 minor 0x1 status 0x0
    panfrost 23140000.gpu: features: 00000000,67c00007, issues: 00000001,80000400
    panfrost 23140000.gpu: Features: L2:0x07120206 Shader:0x00000000 Tiler:0x00000809 ...
    panfrost 23140000.gpu: shader_present=0x5 l2_present=0x1
    [drm] Initialized panfrost 1.2.0 20180908 for 23140000.gpu on minor 0

`0x9091` is the G57 ID (`panfrost_model_cmp()` masks it to `0x9001` to match the
model table) and `0x5` is two shader cores, non-contiguous -- the same value an
independent G57 MC2 bring-up reports.

Three details that each cost an hour:

* `dcdc_gpu_pd` points at `&pmu_apb_regs`, but kbase replaces the regmap
  underneath it with the PMIC's (`sprd,ump962x-syscon`) before using it; the DT
  comment calls the address fake.  `sprd_pmic_regmap()` does the same and keeps
  the parsed register/mask pair.
* the vendor DT names its interrupts `"JOB"`, `"MMU"` and `"GPU"` -- all three on
  the same GIC line -- and `of_irq_get_byname()` is case sensitive, so a mainline
  driver finds no interrupts at all.  `panfrost_irq_get()` walks
  `interrupt-names` case-insensitively as a fallback, quietly: the first version
  asked with `platform_get_irq_byname()` and printed three "IRQ x not found"
  lines per boot for lookups that then succeeded.
* the frequency is set by writing a DVFS *index* into a syscon, and the clocks in
  the node are shared PLL parents, so `clk_set_rate()` must not be used on them:
  devfreq is skipped for this board through a new
  `panfrost_compatible.no_devfreq`.

**Userspace is stock Debian.**  Nothing was installed for this -- Mesa 25.0.7
already carries panfrost.  The session only had to stop being told not to use
it (`/etc/environment` forced `llvmpipe`) and wlroots had to be told to look:

    [render/gles2/renderer.c:538] Creating GLES2 renderer
    [render/gles2/renderer.c:539] Using OpenGL ES 3.1 Mesa 25.0.7-2+deb13u1
    [render/gles2/renderer.c:541] GL renderer: Mali-G57 (Panfrost)

and a *client* gets hardware too, which is what the blob could never do (20.6):
`eglinfo` on the Wayland platform now reports
`OpenGL ES profile renderer: Mali-G57 (Panfrost)` where it used to report
llvmpipe.  The display is being scanned out from a compositor buffer as well:

    plane[31]: crtc=dispc0  fb=121  format=XR24  size=320x480
            allocated by = phoc.orig
            imported=no

**Two traps, both found the hard way.**

* `sprd_gem_dumb_create()` counts every `DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB` in a static
  variable that is never reset, and refuses the 11th request of each boot with
  `-EINVAL`.  wlroots allocates its primary swapchain through exactly that
  ioctl -- the KMS state above is the proof: Mesa's kmsro renders on panfrost,
  but the *display* device allocates the buffer (`imported=no`) -- so a second
  session in the same boot dies with

      MESA: error: Failed to create scanout resource
      DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB failed: Invalid argument
      [render/allocator/gbm.c:116] gbm_bo_create failed
      [render/swapchain.c:110] Failed to allocate buffer
      [types/output/swapchain.c:109] Swapchain for output 'DSI-1' failed test

  and the panel stays black until the next reboot, because a compositor that
  cannot build a swapchain does not modeset at all.  The cap is 64 now
  (kernel patch 0006).
* splitting the two devices explicitly -- which is the shape this hardware wants
  -- does not work with libseat/logind here:

      Opening fixed list of KMS devices from WLR_DRM_DEVICES: /dev/dri/card0:/dev/dri/renderD128
      Unable to open /dev/dri/card0 as KMS device
      [libseat] Could not take device: No such device
      Failed to open device: '/dev/dri/renderD128': Resource temporarily unavailable
      Found 0 GPUs, cannot create backend

  wlroots opens each entry from the list as a KMS device through libseat, logind
  refuses both, and the session never starts at all.  Worth remembering anyway:
  panfrost registers first and takes `card0`, so **the display is `card1`** and
  the GPU is `card0` -- the opposite of the way 20.1-20.6 refer to them, and a
  `WLR_DRM_DEVICES` list written from those notes would name the wrong device.

**What the blob path leaves behind.**  It is retired, not because it broke but
because panfrost makes it pointless: `rootfs/overlay/opt/e5/gpu-mali-setup` is
gone, the session no longer installs a `/usr/bin/phoc` wrapper (an overlay copy
of it would have to carry a copy of the binary), and the dma-heap udev rule is
kept only because opening those heaps is not specific to Mali.
`CONFIG_MALI_MIDGARD=m` with nothing loading the module is what keeps kbase off
the node (`modprobe mali_kbase` is the way back).

**What it does not get you: PanVK.**  Mesa has no Valhall v9 backend for it, by
design -- `src/panfrost/vulkan/meson.build` builds `jm_archs = [6, 7]` and its
arch loop skips 9, because the `jm/` command-buffer code is Bifrost-only.  The
only v9 Vulkan that exists is a reverse-engineering bring-up with compute and
offscreen draws working and no WSI/present, i.e. no swapchain and therefore no
compositor.  So G57 gets OpenGL/GLES 3.1 from panfrost and no Vulkan at all --
which is enough for the actual problem (the clients stuck on llvmpipe are a
GL/EGL problem, not a Vulkan one), but Vulkan is off the table either way.

## 21. Display scaling on a 320x480 panel: what fits, and what the resampling costs

The panel is 320x480 at ~166 DPI while phosh lays its UI out for something closer to
360x720, so `[output:DSI-1] scale` in phoc.ini is a three-way compromise between the
on-screen keyboard, the lock screen and text size.  All five options were measured on
the device (grim captures; the "logical" column is exactly the capture size):

| scale | logical | resample | on-screen keyboard | lock screen | text-scaling |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.0 | 320x480 | 0 % | cut on the right | unlock button off-screen | 0.85 |
| **0.9** | **355x533** | **10 %** | fits | unlock button half off | **0.85** (set) |
| 0.85 | 376x565 | 15 % | fits | unlock button just cut | 0.90 |
| 0.8 | 400x600 | 20 % | fits | fits | 0.85 (text too small) |
| 0.75 | 426x640 | 25 % | fits | fits | 1.0 (visibly soft) |

* A Wayland output scale below 1 is *fractional*: the compositor renders the output at
  `mode/scale` (grim reports 426x640 at 0.75 and 355x533 at 0.9) and the display
  controller scales that down to 320x480.  Both GTK 4.18.6 and wlroots 0.18.2 *do*
  implement `wp_fractional_scale_v1` (grepping the libraries directly for
  `wp_fractional_scale[a-z_]*` hits in both; `strings` is not installed on the
  device, which is what made an earlier check report zero), so the softness is the
  resampling itself, not a missing protocol.
* Physical text size is roughly `text-scaling-factor * scale`, and the keyboard
  constraint caps that product at about 0.8 whatever the split is: the OSK's layout is
  ~339 logical px wide at ts 0.85, so `320/scale >= 339 * ts/0.85`.
* The lock screen needs ~575 logical px of height, i.e. `scale <= ~0.84`; above that
  its unlock button sits half below the screen.  That no longer matters -- the keypad's
  confirm key submits the PIN (section 12.1) and the arrow keys can move the focus to
  the button -- so 0.9 was chosen, for the sharpest text whose keyboard still fits and
  for the in-system text size that was found comfortable.
* `sm.puri.phoc scale-to-fit = true` makes phoc scale down windows that are larger than
  the output, which is what keeps apps written for >=360 px usable.
* **2026-09-26: back to scale 1**, after evaluating scale 0.9: with the text
  scaled up in Settings (text-scaling-factor 1.25) too many buttons ended up off the
  screen, and the panel's own resolution is the one without resampling.  The output
  can be changed live (`wlr-randr --output DSI-1 --scale <s>` in the session; phoc
  implements wlr-output-management), phoc.ini is what a new session starts with.

**The system font size is the user's call, and the toggle is built in.**  Everything
above is about the *output* scale; the *font* is
`org.gnome.desktop.interface text-scaling-factor`, which phosh exposes as
Settings -> Accessibility -> "Large Text" (and which renders at the chosen size, so it
stays sharp).  That is the control to reach for -- the panel ends up at 1.25 here,
which is 47 % larger text than the 0.85 this started with, with nothing but the
on-screen keyboard and the lock screen caring.

Trying to widen that budget by replacing the OSK did not work: Debian's
`squeekboard` ships (its layouts are compiled into the binary) and it starts,
registers as a gnome-session client and connects to Wayland -- and then exits with

    DEBUG: Registered client at '/org/gnome/SessionManager/Client25'
    WARNING: DBus unavailable, unclear how to continue. Is Squeekboard already running?

even when nothing owns `sm.puri.OSK0` (verified with `GetNameOwner`: NameHasNoOwner),
through D-Bus activation from a service file as well as by hand.  phosh's
`phosh-osk-stub --allow-replacement` is what runs, and its layout is a fixed width --
which is why the keyboard itself is the thing that suffers from a large font.



## 20. The hotspot needed the regulatory database in the initramfs

`hostapd` installs and `wlan0` does switch to AP mode (`iw dev wlan0 set type __ap`),
but hostapd refused to start: `Failed to set beacon parameters` on 2.4 GHz, and on 5 GHz
`Frequency 5180 (primary) not allowed for AP mode, flags: 0x853 NO-IR`.  `iw reg get`
answered `country 00: DFS-UNSET`, and `iw reg set CN` never changed that: **cfg80211 loads
`regulatory.db` from firmware when it initialises**, and here it initialises in the
initramfs -- before the root filesystem, and therefore before `/lib/firmware`, exists.
The request is one-shot: it waits in the sysfs firmware fallback (the trick MU300's
`regdb-load` uses) and times out long before a systemd service could feed it.  Without
the database cfg80211 cannot apply CN's rules, so every channel stays NO-IR and hostapd
cannot transmit beacons -- which is what "client cannot join" looked like.

Feeding it late cannot work either, and neither can reloading the modules: the running
rootfs has no `/lib/modules` at all (the vendor modules live only in the initramfs), so
`sprd_wlan_combo`/`wcn_bsp`/`cfg80211` cannot be unloaded and re-inserted to re-issue the
request.

The fix is in the image: `regulatory.db` and `regulatory.db.p7s` (from `wireless-regdb`,
6 KiB together) now sit in `rootfs/overlay/lib/firmware/`, and `boot/init` copies the
overlay's `lib/` to `/lib` *before* loading the WCN modules (`stage=overlay-early`), so
cfg80211 finds them the moment it asks.  **The hotspot therefore needs a reflash** of the
rebuilt image; the device currently runs the previous one.

For reference, the parameters this chip wants (from MU300's `hotspot-start`): 5 GHz
`hw_mode=a channel=36 ht_capab=[HT40+][SHORT-GI-20][SHORT-GI-40] ieee80211ac=1
vht_oper_chwidth=1 vht_oper_centr_freq_seg0_idx=42`, or 2.4 GHz `hw_mode=g channel=6
ht_capab=[SHORT-GI-20]`, with `country_code=CN` and `ieee80211d=1`.

### 20.1 What it took to get `AP-ENABLED`

Four things, in the order they were discovered:

1. **A signed regulatory database, upstream variant.** The kernel's own words were
   `cfg80211: loaded regulatory.db is malformed or signature is missing/invalid`: Debian's
   `wireless-regdb` build (`regulatory.db-debian`) is signed with Debian's key, while this
   vendor kernel only carries the upstream `sforshee`/`wens` certificates.  The
   `-upstream` pair works, and it has to be in the **initramfs** because cfg80211 asks for
   it when the WCN modules load (see section 20 for why a late feed cannot work).
2. **The country has to be set explicitly** even with the database present: cfg80211 starts
   in the world domain (`country 00`).  With a valid database `iw reg set CN` finally takes
   effect -- `country CN: DFS-FCC` with real rules -- and before that it silently did
   nothing, which is why every channel read `NO-IR`.
3. **The DT's `wcnmodem` partition** was still faked with a loop device over
   `/lib/firmware/wcnmodem.bin` here.  It was never needed (8.3) and was later found to
   break the firmware load outright (`ETXTBSY`, section 29); it is gone.  The service
   gates on the firmware file.
4. `wlan0` must be free: `wpa_supplicant.service` stopped and masked, and the interface
   marked unmanaged in NetworkManager.

Verified on the device:

    iw reg get                     -> country CN: DFS-FCC
    hostapd /etc/hostapd/e5.conf   -> wlan0: interface state COUNTRY_UPDATE->ENABLED
                                      wlan0: AP-ENABLED
    iw dev wlan0 info              -> type AP, ssid E5-Linux
    ip -br addr show wlan0         -> 192.168.78.1/24
    systemctl is-active e5-hotspot.service -> active

clients get a lease from systemd-networkd's DHCPServer
(`etc/systemd/network/20-e5-wlan0.network`, 192.168.78.10-29) and are NATed out through
`sipa_eth0` by the rules `mobile-data up` installs.  SSID `E5-Linux`, password
`12345678`; a 5 GHz profile is in `etc/hostapd/e5-5g.conf` for when the regulatory domain
allows channel 36 (this one did not, `NO-IR`, until the database loaded).

### 20.2 Clients got an address but no internet (two traps)

1. **No resolver behind the address.**  systemd-networkd's `DHCPServer=yes` advertises its
   own address as DNS by default, and this image runs no DNS server at all (no dnsmasq, no
   systemd-resolved), so a client could ping IPs but resolve nothing.  The interface's
   `.network` now sets `EmitDNS=no` and `hotspot-start.sh` writes the nameservers
   `/etc/resolv.conf` actually has into
   `/etc/systemd/network/20-e5-wlan0.network.d/10-dns.conf`, so the lease carries the
   carrier's resolvers.
2. **systemd ignores config files that are not root-owned.**  Files pushed from the host
   keep the host uid (501) and a 0600 mode; hostapd did not care, but networkd silently
   skipped the file -- `networkctl status wlan0` showed `Network File: n/a`, `State:
   unmanaged` and no address, and for a while that looked like the DHCP server had broken.
   Any config file that lands on the device by hand needs
   `chown root:root` + a readable mode.

Verified after both fixes:

    Network File: /etc/systemd/network/20-e5-wlan0.network
                  + .../20-e5-wlan0.network.d/10-dns.conf
    State: routable (configured)   Address: 192.168.78.1
    DNS: 223.5.5.5 119.29.29.29 58.240.57.33 221.6.4.66
    DHCP server listening on 0.0.0.0%wlan0:67

A client that already holds a lease has to reconnect (or let the lease renew) to pick up
the new DNS option.

### 20.3 dnsmasq does the hotspot's DHCP and DNS

`systemd-networkd`'s DHCPServer cannot answer the DNS queries it advertises, and with
`EmitDNS=no` plus a static `DNS=` list the lease carried the carrier's resolvers but the
client still did not resolve (it was the lease renewal that decided it, and a static list
also breaks whenever the carrier changes servers).  `dnsmasq` does both jobs properly:

    /etc/dnsmasq.d/e5-hotspot.conf
      interface=wlan0, interface=usb0, bind-interfaces
      no-dhcp-interface=usb0                 (usb0's leases stay with networkd)
      dhcp-range=192.168.9.10,192.168.9.61,255.255.255.0,12h
      dhcp-option=option:router,192.168.9.1
      dhcp-option=option:dns-server,192.168.9.1

and `wlan0`'s `.network` went back to address-only (`DHCPServer=no`), so nothing competes.
Verified: `dnsmasq --test` OK, `dnsmasq: active` (enabled), listening on
`192.168.9.1:53`, `192.168.77.1:53` and `127.0.0.1:53`, and
`busybox nslookup deb.debian.org 192.168.9.1` resolves -- so a client that renews its
lease gets `192.168.9.x`, gateway `192.168.9.1` and a resolver that actually answers.

### 20.4 Channel 149 at 80 MHz works -- the stall was the regulatory domain

For a while the tree kept the hotspot at 20 MHz because 40 MHz and 80 MHz both left
hostapd in `COUNTRY_UPDATE->HT_SCAN` and never at `AP-ENABLED`.  That was not the width;
it was the same missing country as section 20.  With `country CN: DFS-FCC` the driver's
own regulatory list reads

    nl80211: 5725-5850 @ 80 MHz 33 mBm

and with `ieee80211ac=1`, `ht_capab=[HT40+]`, `vht_oper_chwidth=1` and
`vht_oper_centr_freq_seg0_idx=155` hostapd sets

    nl80211: Set freq 5745 (ht_enabled=1, vht_enabled=1, he_enabled=0, bandwidth=80 MHz, cf1=5775 MHz, cf2=0 MHz)

The beacon (parsed from hostapd's own `-dd` hexdump with `work/parse-beacon.py`) carries
HT Operation primary 149 / secondary offset 1 (HT40+) and **VHT Operation `width=1`
(80 MHz), seg0=155, seg1=0** -- the 149/153/157/161 block.  Four start attempts (with and
without a preceding `iw dev wlan0 scan`; with and without a pre-set
`iw dev wlan0 set channel 149 80MHZ`) all reached `AP-ENABLED`, so
`opt/e5/hotspot-start.sh` no longer configures the channel and
`etc/hostapd/e5.conf` is the 80 MHz profile (the old 20 MHz one is in git history).

Two things to keep in mind:

* The 5 GHz band's own capabilities are fine: `iw phy` says `HT20/HT40`, and the wiphy's
  VHT max width is 80 MHz (`Supported Channel Width: neither 160 nor 80+80`), while the
  driver's regulatory list allows 80 MHz on 5725-5850.
* The VHT *Capabilities* IE still advertises `SupportedChannelWidthSet=0` (20/40) even
  though the operation element says 80 MHz.  That bit is inherited from the driver's
  `hw vht capab: 0x1b07031`, which has it clear -- the vendor driver claims 20/40 in its
  capability IE while running 80 MHz.  A client that trusts the operation element gets
  80 MHz, which is why the acceptance test is a real client's link rate, not the beacon.

### 20.5 The old "HT_SCAN hang" note, corrected

The earlier commits (fdc0494 and a38122d) disagreed about whether pre-setting the channel
while the interface was down helped.  It did not matter either way: what changed between
"hangs in HT_SCAN" and the measurements above is the country.  hostapd's 40 MHz
coexistence scan (`Scan for neighboring BSSes prior to enabling 40 MHz channel`) does run
and complete in the working case; with every 5 GHz channel NO-IR it had nothing to settle
on and never left `HT_SCAN`.


## 22. The baseband CP assert: the URC channel, the RIL-shaped AT channel, the watchdog

### The symptom, and the empty run

A boot brings the bearer up (`+CPIN: READY`, `+CEREG: 2,1,...,11` = NR SA,
`AT+CGDATA="M-ETHER",1`, `sipa_eth0` with its address and a `metric 100` default
route), and at about 9.5 minutes the CP stops answering.  The kernel log then
carries the CP's own words:

    modem cmd Modem Assert: MN_AL Task PS CP assert in file
    MS_System/RTOS/source/src_osa/c/threadx_os_iram.c line 1115
    exp=ASSERT: Error 0xb, The queue was full info=[], [dfs=5]

Trusty restarts the CP (`enter SEC_KBC_START_CP` -> `kbc_start_cp() enter
MODEM_IMG`) and the AT channel does not come back; only a reboot recovers it.  The
empty run settled the trigger: with `e5-mobile-data` and its watcher stopped and
no AT at all, **uptime 17 minutes passed with zero `CP assert` hits**, while a
session that polls AT died at ~9.5 minutes.

### The two channels

Measured on 2026-09-18 with the watcher stopped and nobody holding a channel:

* `/dev/stty_nr0` is the **URC channel**.  Opening it dumps the queue that piled
  up since the last reader: `+SIND: 1`, `+SIND: 10,"SM",1,"FD",1,...`,
  `+ECIND: 3,0,0,1`, `+ECIND: 3,6,1`, `+CMGW: ME is full`, `+PRENWINFU:"46001"`,
  `+CREG: 2`, `+CEREG: 2`, then a periodic `+CSQ: 255,99` / `+CESQ:
  99,99,255,255,255,255,75,67,73` pair (signal fields invalid, ME storage full),
  and later the bearer events `+CGEV: ME PDN ACT 1` / `+SPPCODATA: 1`.  A 45 s
  read produced tens of lines, a later 8 s read 63 lines (~6 lines/s).
* `/dev/stty_nr1` is a **clean command channel**: it stays silent while idle and
  answers `AT`, `AT+CEREG?`, `AT+COPS?` normally.  MU300-linux saw the same
  `nr0`=URC / `nr1`=command split on the same modem family.

Our code never read `nr0` at all, and `mobile-data`'s `at()` opened
`/dev/stty_nr1`, drained 0.2 s of backlog, wrote one command, read to `OK` and
closed the port again -- for every command, every 30 s, from the bearer watcher.
Android's RIL does the opposite: it holds the channel open for the lifetime of
the boot and reads the URC stream continuously (`urild` is the process that does
it on this device).

### A second, different death: AT dies without an assert

On 2026-09-18 22:03-22:09 the AT server was observed dying on its own, with the
watcher stopped and nobody holding either channel:

* 22:03:14 (`uptime 1765`) a bare `AT` on `nr1` answered `OK`, and an `nr0` read
  dumped the URC backlog above;
* by 22:07 both channels returned nothing at all, and at 22:09 a bare `AT`
  produced no `OK`, no `ERROR` and no URC -- no process had the channel open;
* `dmesg` `CP assert` hits = 0, there was no `kbc_start_cp` after boot, and
  `busybox wget` through `sipa_eth0` still worked (the address stayed up).

So "the AT channel is dead" and "the CP has asserted" are not the same event, and
the bearer can keep passing traffic after AT is gone.  A watchdog has to key on
AT's silence, not on the CP assert appearing in dmesg.

### The fix: a persistent, RIL-shaped AT channel

`rootfs/overlay/opt/e5/atd.py` (`e5-atd.service`) is a small daemon that opens
`nr0` and `nr1` **once** and keeps them open for the whole boot:

* it drains `nr0` continuously into `/var/log/e5-atd.urc` (rotated at 256 KiB)
  and never closes the port;
* commands from `mobile-data` arrive on the `/run/e5-atd.sock` unix socket and are
  serialised with a 0.3 s minimum gap, one in flight at a time, with an 8 s
  timeout, so no caller can flood the CP;
* URCs are interleaved with the command's own response rather than being lost;
* when idle for 60 s it sends a bare `AT` and records the answer as the liveness
  signal, and it publishes `/run/e5-atd.state` (JSON: `last_ok`, `last_rx`,
  `urc_lines`, `commands`, `fails`, channel flags) for the watchdog;
* the channels are reopened with backoff if they disappear, so a CP restart no
  longer leaves a dead port behind.

`mobile-data` asks for its AT through the daemon (`at()` falls back to the old
direct path only if `/opt/e5/atd.py` is not installed), and its watcher now
checks the interface every 30 s but asks the modem about `+CEREG?`/`+CGACT?` only
once every five minutes instead of every 30 s.

Measured after deploying it (2026-09-18, uptime 31 min, watcher up for 17 min):
`CP assert` hits = 0, `AT+COPS?` -> `+COPS: 0,2,"46001",11`, `sipa_eth0` still up
and `busybox wget http://mirror.nju.edu.cn/...` fine -- where the previous
regime asserted at ~9.5 minutes.  (Correlation, not proof: the watcher's AT
volume is now ~1.4 commands/min against ~4/min before, so either the persistent
channel or the lower rate may be what helps.  The daemon does both, which is what
the RIL does.)

### The watchdog

There is no userspace modem reset on this board: `/sys/class/misc` has no modem
node and restarting `e5-vendor.service` sends `cmd 0x43c84e06`, which only
re-triggers the same assert 19 s later.  So the honest recovery for a silent AT
channel is a reboot, done by `rootfs/overlay/opt/e5/cp-watchdog`
(`e5-cp-watchdog.service`, `/etc/e5/cp-watchdog.conf`):

* dead = the daemon's `last_ok` is older than `DEAD_AFTER` (default 120 s);
* on death it appends the evidence to `/var/log/e5-cp-watchdog.log` -- uptime,
  the atd state, the last URCs, the `modem`/`CP assert`/`kbc_*` lines from dmesg
  and `ip -s link show sipa_eth0` -- then re-arms the boot slot
  (`/usr/local/sbin/e5-boot-ok`, which matters because `e5-boot-ok.service` is
  disabled on the device right now and a plain reboot would otherwise fall back
  to Android) and runs `systemctl reboot`;
* `GUARD` (900 s) refuses a second watchdog reboot inside the window and only
  logs it, so a CP that dies again immediately cannot turn into a boot loop;
* `ACTION=log` observes without rebooting, and `--simulate` was used to test the
  decision: with a fake state whose `last_ok` was 400 s old, the watchdog
  reported "AT channel has not answered for 415 s" with the evidence block at the
  first check and refused to reboot under `ACTION=log`.

## 23. The two open documentation debts, paid

* **Identity strings.**  `rootfs/overlay/etc/machine-info` sets `PRETTY_HOSTNAME=
  Rongyue E5` (the static hostname cannot contain a space, so the login prompt
  keeps `e5-linux`).  `HARDWARE_VENDOR`/`HARDWARE_MODEL` are deliberately unset --
  they fill the "Hardware Model" row, while the part name belongs in "Processor",
  which is built from `/proc/cpuinfo` and is therefore set in the kernel
  (`kernel/patches/0009` prints `Processor: Unisoc T158`).
* **The 32 s shutdown.**  Measured 2026-09-18: everything stops inside 1.3 s
  (`bluetooth.service` in 0.25 s) and the journal is then silent from
  NetworkManager's `modem-manager: ModemManager no longer available` at
  14:57:01.108 until NM's own `exiting (success)` at 14:57:33.001 -- NM waits on
  device teardown that does not complete here (the WLAN firmware does not answer
  a disconnect promptly).  `NetworkManager.service.d/20-e5-shutdown-timeout.conf`
  (`TimeoutStopSec=5`) did not shorten the total in the one test after it: NM's
  stop is issued late in the sequence, so the time is spent before it is reached.
  Re-measure on a booted image before believing anything else here.


## 24. Audio: the AP path streams, ALSA never sees a period, and the AGDSP is the missing piece

The vendor sound stack does come up on this port -- card `sprdphone-sc2730`, codec
`ump9620`, the AW87xxx smart PA on i2c 6-0058 parsing its profile out of
`aw87xxx_acf.bin` -- but two things must also be true before a PCM can even be
opened, and a third before an ALSA client can finish a buffer.

### 24.1 What the stack needs to load

* The audio modules (`sound/soc/sprd/unisoc/*` + `drivers/unisoc_platform/sprd_audio/*`,
  24 modules) are loaded from the initramfs by a name list, so their *order* is ours.
  `sprd_dmaengine_pcm` failed with `Unknown symbol get_sp_audio_debug_flag /
  sprd_tdm_dai_to_config / sprd_mmap_fd_set (err -2)` because two of those three are
  exported by `snd_soc_sprd_card.ko`, which was listed *after* it; deriving the order
  from real symbol dependencies (`nm -g --defined-only` / `-u`) fixed that, and
  `stage=modules-done loaded=91 failed=0` is the check that it stayed fixed.
* The ASoC card also wants the AGDSP power domain.  With `agdsp_pd.ko` absent or
  neutralised, `asoc_sprd_card_parse_of: Parsing dai link 0 failed(-517)` loops
  forever, because the codec and the VBC DAI name that domain as their
  `power-domains` provider.  The three variants that were tried are in the STATUS
  narrative; the tree carries the hybrid one now (no legacy `smsg` kthread, PMU state
  read before the mailbox wake, no vendor power-off sequence).

### 24.2 The AP path itself works

Two controls turn "the DMA runs one burst and stops" into "the VBC FIFO drains":

* `agdsp_access_en` = 1, which is `REG_AON_APB_AUDCP_CTRL` (0x6490014c) bit 5,
  `MASK_AON_APB_AP_2_AUD_ACCESS_EN`.  It opens AP access to the AGCP domain, and with
  it the `audcp-{vbc,aud,dma-ap,mcdt,icu,tmr-26m,dvfs-aspb,intc}-eb` clocks match
  Android's.  Measured: 0x6490014c reads 0x20 with it, and the DMA pointer then
  advances and wraps instead of stalling after a single 640-byte burst.
* `VBC DAC0 DG Set` must be non-zero (Android runs it at 39,39).  Linux leaves it at
  0, which is digital silence however well the route is wired.

The full list is `/root/e5-spk-recipe.sh` on the device, derived by diffing Android's
mixer state (`/system/bin/tinymix`) while it was playing a ringtone against Linux's
idle state.  With it applied a playback to `hw:0,0` really does stream: with the two
AGCP DMA channels enabled (`GLB_CHN_EN_STS` 0x5665001c = 0x3), the VBC playback FIFO
status (0x56510034) walks 0x29c21 -> 0xd4a1 -> 0x1a0c1 -> 0x17ce1 as the DMA consumes
it.

### 24.3 The blocker: no period boundary ever reaches ALSA

Measured during that playback (`busybox devmem`):

| where | register | value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AGCP DMA @0x56650000 | `GLB_INT_RAW_STS` 0x10 | 0x3 |
| | `GLB_INT_MSK_STS` 0x14 | 0x3 |
| | `GLB_REQ_STS` 0x18 | 0x0 |
| | `GLB_CHN_EN_STS` 0x1c | 0x3 |
| VBC AP regs @0x56510000 | `AUDPLY_FIFO_CTRL` 0x20 | 0x00f00650 |
| | `AUD_EN` 0x2c | 0x300 |
| | `AUDPLY_FIFO0_STS` 0x34 | moving |
| | `AUD_INT_EN` 0x44 | 0x4 |
| | `AUD_INT_STS` 0x48 | 0x10 (sticky) |
| | `AUD_CHNL_INT_SEL` 0x4c | 0x0000 |
| | `AUD_DMA_EN` 0x50 | 0x3 |

Both interrupt-status registers sit pending and are never cleared, and the
`/proc/interrupts` lines `28: GICv3 251 sprd_dma` (AP DMA) and `40: GICv3 87
sprd_dma` -- the DT's `agcp_dma@56650000`, `interrupts = <GIC_SPI 55>` -- both stay
at 0 for the whole run.  The data path completes, the completion *event* does not:
nothing in the vendor audio tree calls `snd_pcm_period_elapsed()` except the DMA
callback `sprd_pcm_dma_buf_done()`, and that callback never runs.

Two definitions the routing would need are dead code here: `REG_VBC_AUD_CHNL_INT_SEL`
(0x004c, the AP/DSP channel-interrupt selector) and its DSP-window twin
`REG_VBC_CHNL_INT_SEL` (`VBC_DSP_ADDR_BASE + 0x0f74`) are *defined but never
written*, and `REG_VBC_AUD_INT_EN` (0x0044) has no writer either.  On Android that is
the AGDSP firmware's job -- the one piece this port does not run.

What that does to a plain ALSA client:

* `sprd_pcm_pointer()` is not the problem.  It returns
  `dmaengine_tx_status().residue`, and `sprd_dma_tx_status()` reads the *live*
  channel address (`sprd_dma_get_src_addr()` / `sprd_dma_get_dst_addr()`) whenever the
  descriptor is the current one, so the position is accurate without a single
  interrupt.
* ALSA's *cached* `hw_ptr`, however, only moves when the driver calls
  `snd_pcm_period_elapsed()`.  Probe on `hw:0,0`: the first two 4096-frame blocking
  writes return immediately (avail 5504 -> 1408), the third blocks and never returns,
  and `snd_pcm_drain()` then waits forever because its loop only breaks on the state
  change a period tick would have produced.  `aplay` prints `Playing WAVE ...` and
  hangs in exactly the same place.
* Android never sees this because its HAL opens the PCM with `PCM_NOIRQ`
  (`SNDRV_PCM_HW_PARAMS_NO_PERIOD_WAKEUP`): `sprd-dmaengine-pcm.c` then builds the
  link-list node with `SPRD_DMA_FLAGS(0, 0, SPRD_DMA_FRAG_REQ, SPRD_DMA_NO_INT)` and
  registers no callback at all -- it feeds the DMA from a timer and never waits on a
  period.  `p_wakeup = !(params->flags & SNDRV_PCM_HW_PARAMS_NO_PERIOD_WAKEUP)` is the
  whole difference.

### 24.4 The tried fix, reverted, and the two traps in it

A software period ticker calling `snd_pcm_period_elapsed()` (module parameter
`period_timer`, delay `period_size / rate`) was added to `sprd-dmaengine-pcm.c` and
tried as a `timer_list` and then as a `delayed_work`.  Both images panicked within
about a minute of the desktop session opening the PCM, so the change was dropped in
full and the trigger was never isolated.  What the attempt did establish:

* **A softirq cannot be the context.**  `normal_dma_protect_spin_lock()` is
  `spin_lock(&pm_dma->pm_splk_dma_prot)` -- plain `spin_lock()`, no irqsave -- and
  `sprd_pcm_pointer()` takes it for the normal playback streams, as do
  open/hw_params/trigger/hw_free/close.  A timer that lands on a CPU already inside one
  of those sections spins on a lock that CPU can only release after the softirq
  returns: a soft lockup, and this configuration panics on one
  (`CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_SOFTLOCKUP_PANIC=y`, `CONFIG_BOOTPARAM_HUNG_TASK_PANIC=y`).  A
  workqueue removes that self-deadlock, but the second image still died.
* **Do not cancel synchronously where a tick can re-enter.**  A period tick can drive
  `snd_pcm_stop()` into the driver's `trigger(STOP)`, so anything armed there must use
  `cancel_delayed_work()`; only `sprd_pcm_close()` may use the `_sync` form, and ALSA
  does reach it without the stream lock (`snd_pcm_release_substream()` calls
  `do_hw_free()` and `ops->close()` outside the lock).  `sprd_pcm_hw_free()` releases
  the DMA channels and `sprd_pcm_close()` frees `rtd`, so the tick has to be stopped
  before either.

No panic text survived: `sysdump.ko` is not in the image, so `sysdumpdb` still holds
only Android's old reports, and `/sys/fs/pstore` stays empty even though ramoops
registers as a backend.  The one thing that did work is the 4 MiB block at 56 MiB
inside `boot_b` that `boot/init` rewrites every 15 s
(`dd if=/dev/block/by-name/boot_b bs=1M skip=56 count=8` from Android reads it back):
it stops at `switch-root`, so a copy of that loop inside the real rootfs is what
captured the last `dmesg` before a post-switch-root death.

### 24.5 Two boot traps found while chasing the panics

* **`sysctl.kernel.panic_on_oops=0` must stay in the cmdline.**  This config sets
  `CONFIG_PANIC_ON_OOPS=y`, and the image has a pre-existing oops at ~25 s:
  `Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffffffc00ac1b7d8` with
  `string -> vsnprintf -> add_uevent_var -> kobject_uevent_env -> kobject_synth_uevent
  -> uevent_store`.  An image whose cmdline dropped the parameter panics on that same
  oops; with it, the task dies and the boot continues.  The `_regulator_disable`
  WARNING (`drivers/regulator/core.c:3002`, twice a boot) and the `dev_watchdog`
  TX-timeout WARNING (`net/sched/sch_generic.c:481`) are noise.
* **From Android, arm the slot and reset with sysrq, not `adb reboot`.**  Android's
  init rewrites the A/B metadata on a clean reboot, so a slot-b BCB written just before
  `adb reboot` is lost and the device comes back on slot a.
  `echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq; echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger` resets without that
  rewrite and boots the armed slot (verified both ways).

### 24.6 What is still open

_Resolved 2026-09-25 by the second bullet (an hrtimer ticker with the lock made
irqsave) -- see 24.8.  The interrupt still does not arrive with the DSP running._

* Route the completion interrupt to the AP: find who is supposed to write
  `REG_VBC_AUD_CHNL_INT_SEL` / `REG_VBC_AUD_INT_EN`, or whether the AGCP DMA line is
  simply not wired to the GIC on this part.  The AGDSP firmware is the suspect for
  both, and it is not running here.
* Or tick the period from a context that cannot deadlock on `pm_splk_dma_prot` -- a
  kthread with a try-lock, or making that lock irqsave where the process-context paths
  take it -- and stop it before `sprd_pcm_hw_free()` / `sprd_pcm_close()`.
* Or sidestep the question for a first audibility test: open the PCM
  `PCM_NOIRQ`-style (`SNDRV_PCM_HW_PARAMS_NO_PERIOD_WAKEUP`), feed it at a fixed rate
  and listen.  That path needs no interrupt at all, and it is the one Android uses.

### 24.7 The E5 ships the missing piece: measured on Android, 2026-09-23

_One `adb root` session against the handset's own Android, no flashing.  It settles
who was supposed to write the interrupt-selector registers, and where the AGDSP
image was all along._

* **The firmware is on the device.**  The F50 has no audio DSP partition and mu300
  had to hunt a donor image; this device has `l_agdsp_a` / `l_agdsp_b` in the GPT
  (`/dev/block/mmcblk0p26` / `p27`).  The image is 6 MiB with the header
  `SharkL5_AUDCP_2023Y_VER_3029` (`AUDCP.SharkL6`, sha256 `6384966f...a6157a`), and
  `audiocp_boot`'s `ldinfo` on the running Android reads `0xafa00000 / 6291456`: the
  image *is* the reserved `audiodsp-mem` region, so it is this SoC's own binary.
* **The device tree is complete where the F50's was stripped.**
  `reserved-memory/audio-mem@af700000` and `audiodsp-mem@afa00000` are present, and
  `audio-mem-mgr` carries `memory-region = <phandle 218> <phandle 219>` -- exactly
  the property whose absence forced mu300's `of-reserved-mem-add` /
  `audio-mem-fixed-region` patches.  None of that machinery is needed here.
* **Android runs the whole stack built-in** -- the card is up (`sprdphone-sc2730`,
  19 PCM devices, `FE_ST_NORMAL_AP01` on 00-00) with zero audio modules in
  `/proc/modules`, and `vbc-rxpx-codec-sc27xx` binds `sound@0`.  The same driver
  sources this port builds as modules are what Android compiled in.
* **The AGDSP is a real, load-bearing component here** (unlike on the audio-less
  F50): `audiocp_boot/status` reads powered-down while idle (`core=7 sys=7`), the
  340-control mixer carries the full profile select/update surface, and /odm has
  the native parameter XMLs (`audio_structure` 0x43 modes x 0x2da, `dsp_vbc` 0x48
  x 0x6c4, `cvs` 0x43 x 0x33c).
* **The bring-up is now ported** (mu300-linux's `mu300-audio-dsp` flow, on this
  device's own firmware): `tools/vbc-profile` converts the XMLs,
  `rootfs/pull-audio-firmware.sh` stages image + blobs into the rootfs overlay, and
  `/opt/e5/e5-audio-dsp` (run by `e5-audio.service` before the session starts, so
  PipeWire only ever sees a card whose DSP is up) does modules -> card registered ->
  firmware write -> DSP start -> speaker route -> profiles.  The modules load from
  the root filesystem (`/usr/lib/modules/<rel>/audio`, modprobe/depmod), not the
  initramfs -- the 2026-09-19 resets were the session's pipewire probing a card
  whose power domain's core had nothing to execute.
* **One correction to 24.1's narrative:** `agdsp_pd` in the kernel tree is the stock
  vendor driver (the "hybrid" variant only ever lived in test images).  That is the
  right base here precisely because it is what Android runs *with the DSP booted*;
  the boot-order guarantee above is what replaces the hybrid's neutralisations.
* **The open question after the first boot of this image** is 24.6's first bullet
  restated: with the DSP actually executing this image, do the AGCP/VBC completion
  interrupts reach the GIC and `snd_pcm_period_elapsed()` fire (in which case
  PipeWire needs nothing else), or not (in which case `/opt/e5/e5-noirq-play` -- the
  `NO_PERIOD_WAKEUP` feeder the Android HAL uses, already in the image -- is the
  audibility test, and the kthread ticker the kernel-side fallback).

### 24.8 The speaker plays (2026-09-25): what it took, and every trap on the way

Confirmed by ear: stock `aplay` on `hw:0,3` and `pw-play` through PipeWire's
"Speaker" sink.  Signal path: FE_FAST (hw:N,3) -> AGDSP FAST_P scene -> VBC DAC0 ->
IIS0 -> UMP9620 DAC -> AO driver (AOL/AOR) -> aw87xxx (i2c 6-0058) -> speaker.

**Card assembly.**  `sound@0` deferring forever looked like the hook parser's
`Get gpio failed:-2` on `sprd,spk-ext-pa-gpio`.  It is not: `asoc_sprd_card_parse_of()`
only propagates `-EPROBE_DEFER` from the hook, an `-ENOENT` just skips it.
`dynamic_debug` on `soc-core.c` gave the real line -- `platform component (null) not
found for link FE_NORMAL_AP01` -- and the missing platform was `/sprd-pcm-audio`,
which had failed with `-ETIMEDOUT` ("deferred probe timeout, ignoring dependency").
This kernel's `driver_deferred_probe_timeout` defaults to **0**, so a module device
that probes before its genpd provider exists fails for good -- and 0010 v2 registers
the agdsp provider only at mailbox setup.  A pure race, which is why the same image
had a card in the morning and none in the evening.  `e5-audio-dsp` re-probes every
unbound `agdsp-power-domain` consumer (their devlinks list them).  Do not "fix" it with
`deferred_probe_timeout=` on the cmdline: `=30` killed the kernel before the initramfs.

**The gpio still mattered -- for the amp.**  The dtb's `<0 1 1 0>` selects
`hook_general_spk_for_aw87xxx`, which drives the amp over i2c only, but the parser
looked the gpio up *first* and dropped the hook, so the aw87xxx sat in profile "Off"
in every Linux test until then.  `kernel/patches/0012`.  Manual stand-in:
`echo Music > /sys/bus/i2c/devices/6-0058/profile`.  `Speaker Mute=1` forces the hook
to on=0 on this kernel (need_mute), so it must stay 0 even though Android's playing
mixer reads 1.

**Periods.**  Both `sprd_dma` lines stay at 0 even with the DSP booted, so
`kernel/patches/0013` ticks `snd_pcm_period_elapsed()` from an hrtimer at the period
rate and always programs the DMA without interrupts; `pm_splk_dma_prot` became
irqsave (24.4's soft lockup), the tick is try-cancelled in trigger and cancelled
synchronously in hw_free/close.  Module param `period_timer=0` restores the old path.

**What made it audible, beyond a routed and powered DAPM graph** (diffing codec, VBC
and aw87xxx registers *while playing* against Android found both):

* The DSP profile selects.  Android plays with `Audio Structure Profile Select = 0`
  and `DSP VBC Profile Select = 0x404B0000`.  The controls are declared
  `max 0x0fffffff`, so amixer clamps 0x404B0000 to 0x0fffffff -- which the driver
  then applies as dsp_case 0xffff.  The kernel `put()` does not range-check:
  `/opt/e5/e5-ctl-raw` writes the element value directly.
* `VBC_IIS_MST_WIDTH_SET` = `MST_WD_16BIT`.  The enum's items are `MST_WD_24BIT` /
  `MST_WD_16BIT`, and tinymix prints them as `WD_16BIT`; a route written from the
  tinymix dump silently matched nothing.
* With both right, `ANA_CDC7` reads 0x000f (AO buffer DC calibration done), as on
  Android.

**Traps.**

* `e5-audio-dsp start` did `set -- $(od ... ldinfo)` and then called
  `do_profiles "${2:-}"` -- the MODE argument was the ldinfo size by then, so every
  cold start selected garbage profiles.  Save positional arguments before reusing `$@`.
* The "IMPD ENABLE" control oopses (strcmp NULL in the headset regulator lookup) if
  written before the headset's codec-side probe fills its regulator table; with
  `panic_on_oops` that is a panic.  An `alsactl` pass at 57 s did exactly that on two
  boots in a row and LK fell back to slot a.  `kernel/patches/0014`.  Who ran that
  alsactl was never found (not the shadowed alsa-restore unit, not udev's rule).
* `alsa-restore.service` must be shadowed by a *regular file*: `boot/init` copies the
  overlay with `find -type f`, so a `/dev/null` symlink never arrives.  The store at
  shutdown is what keeps recreating `asound.state`.
* PipeWire's ACP builds a pro-audio profile by opening, configuring and preparing
  every PCM.  On this card that is 19 DSP scenes, most failing with "no backend DAIs
  enabled" (840 failed PREPAREs in 15 s), and it kept wireplumber at 100 % of a core
  for minutes after every login.  PipeWire 1.4.2 has no switch for it; a WirePlumber
  rule turns ACP off for the card and creates only the hw:N,3 node.  UCM still owns
  the route (`e5-audio-dsp routes` = `alsaucm set _verb HiFi set _enadev Speaker`).
  The ALSA card *driver* name is the card name cut to 15 characters,
  `sprdphone-sc273`, which is what the UCM directory has to be called; UCM also needs
  `alsa-ucm-conf` for `ucm2/ucm.conf`.
* Raw ioctl players: a hw_params mask must be *set* exclusively -- OR-ing a bit into
  the all-ones `any()` mask pins nothing, access falls to MMAP_INTERLEAVED and every
  WRITEI returns EINVAL.  Period 1024 is refused; 960 (20 ms) works.  Capture on
  FE_NORMAL_AP01 is IRAM-backed and capped at 3840 frames / 3 periods.
* Capture does not work yet: the capture DMA never moves (hw_ptr stays 0, arecord
  EIO), on NORMAL_AP01 and on the DSP capture FE alike -- a separate problem.
* Rebuilding modules on the Mac: a single-target `make` runs modpost with vmlinux's
  exports only (sibling exports are "undefined") and rewrites `Module.symvers` as
  vmlinux + those targets.  `work/build-audio-modules.sh` builds the set together
  with `KBUILD_MODPOST_WARN=1`, ships only modules whose imports all resolved, and
  restores the full `Module.symvers`.  Host tools need `C_INCLUDE_PATH=work/hostinc`
  (elf.h) and Homebrew LLVM first in PATH.
* A panicked Linux leaves the rootfs journal dirty: mounting `rootfs.ext4` read-only
  from Android needs `-o ro,noload`, and SELinux must be permissive for the loop
  read (`shell_data_file`); set it back to enforcing afterwards.

## 25. The first on-device takeover: `unisoc-cpd` as the only reader of the AT channel (G2)

_2026-09-20, on the handset booted into Android (slot a), rooted, `urild` the
incumbent owner.  Everything below was done over `adb` with `su`; the binary is
the static `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` build pushed to
`/data/local/tmp/ucpd/` with the e5 profile beside it.  The whole session ran
with `vendor.modem_control` left alone — the CP stays booted when only the RIL
is stopped._

### 25.1 Who holds the channel, before and after

A `/proc/*/fd` scan for `stty_nr0/nr1` is the honest statement of ownership:

* with Android up: exactly one holder, `/vendor/bin/hw/urild`
  (`init.svc.vendor.ril-daemon`); `slogmodem` runs but holds only `slog_*`;
* after `stop vendor.ril-daemon`: **no holder at all** — the channel is free,
  and the takeover is a plain open, not a race.

### 25.2 What worked, first try

As the only reader, every probe and every capability answered:

* `link --seconds 30 --interval 10`: 3/3 probes OK at ~200 ms, **0 timeouts,
  0 errors**, 16 URC lines with `max_gap 0.0 s`, mailbox IRQ delta 41;
* `sim`: `+CPIN: READY` — matches Android's `gsm.sim.state = LOADED,LOADED`;
* `serve` (100 s) + a client over the socket: `sim` and `register status`
  answered through the daemon, and `state` reported `channels.cmd.opens: 1`,
  `reopens: 0` — one open for the whole window, which is the entire point of
  the resident owner;
* the socket `urc` query returned decoded events: the CP pairs a `+CSQ` and a
  `+CESQ` URC roughly twice a second once registered, and the decoder read
  **50 of 50 lines** (`urc_lines 50, decoded 50` — 100 %, no `urc-other`);
* `band lock lte 1 41` / `band lock nr 41 78` both took and read back exactly
  (`+SPLBAND=0` → `0,256,0,1,0`, `+SPLBAND=3` → `0,0,272`);
* 0 CP asserts from beginning to end of the session.

### 25.3 The one thing that did not work, and what actually brings the stack up

Stopping the RIL does not leave the modem runnable: its shutdown path parks the
radio at **`+CFUN: 0`** (`+CEREG: 2,0`, `+CSQ: 0,99`, every `+CESQ` field 255).
The recovery the contract already carried — `AT+SFUN=2`, `AT+SFUN=4` — sets
`+CFUN: 1` but **does not register**: five minutes of waiting stayed at
`+CEREG: 2,0` with no RF, and band locking (LTE b1/b41, NR n41/n78) changed
nothing.  What did work is the full cold cycle the Linux side's `radio_on`
uses:

    AT+CFUN=0 ; then AT+SFUN=2, AT+SFUN=4   →   75 s later:

    +CEREG: 2,1,"10002B","00592002",11      PS registered, home, AcT 11 = NR SA
    +CGATT: 1                               attached

— which matches the Android oracle for that SIM (46015 广电, NR_SA).  The
measurable conclusion: **after a RIL shutdown, `SFUN=2/4` alone is not stack
bring-up; the `CFUN=0 → SFUN=2/4` cold cycle is.**  (Conversely, a CP that
boots without a RIL at all — the Linux case, FINDINGS §22 — registers after
the plain `SFUN` pair, so it is the *RIL-shutdown state* that needs the cold
cycle, not the generation.)

### 25.4 `255` is "not reported", not "-115 dBm"

The unregistered CP answers `+CESQ: 99,99,255,255,255,255,…`, and the literal
`idx-140` mapping turned 255 into "RSRP 115 dBm" — a nonsense number a reader
will believe.  `decode_cesq` now returns `None` for a 255 field and the
display says `not reported`; a *reported* field still decodes (the same line's
SS-SINR 73 → 26.5 dB).

### 25.5 The procedure error the session made, and the rule it fixes

Restoring the vendor side, `start vendor.ril-daemon` was issued while the
100 s `serve` was still alive: the fd scan then showed **`unisoc-cpd` and
`urild` holding the channels at the same time** — the plan's only red line,
violated by sequencing, not by the code (the flock is advisory and `urild`
never takes it; it only coordinates our own instances).  Nothing broke — and
the session had one clean piece of evidence that the daemon *noticed*: its
idle probe failed exactly once, in that window.  The rule for every future
transfer, in both directions:

> **never `start` the other owner until our daemon has exited and the fd scan
> shows the channel free; never `serve` past the point the other side is told
> to start.**  Verify with the `/proc/*/fd` scan, not with an assumption.

### 25.6 Left changed on the device: nothing

The band experiment was reverted before the RIL came back: LTE re-locked to
the RIL's own set (read back `+SPLBAND: 0,482,2056,213,0` = bands
1,3,5,7,8,20,28,34,38,39,40,41) and NR unlocked (`+SPLBAND=2,0,0,0,0`,
read back `(none)`).  After `start vendor.ril-daemon`: `LOADED,LOADED`,
`46015,46001`, `NR_SA,LTE` — identical to the pre-session baseline — and the
closing `diag asserts` read 0.

### 25.7 Second session: SMS surface, the MT path works, the MO path does not

_2026-09-20, same setup (Android slot a, daemon as the only reader), with
`serve` held open for the whole session and clients on its socket._

* **The SMS surface the RIL leaves behind is hostile, and the daemon now
  re-arms it at start-up.**  Measured: `+CSCS: "HEX"` (under which
  `CMGS="<number>"` is not a phone number) and `+CNMI: 0,0,0,1,0` (mt=0 — new
  messages are stored *without* announcing them, so the `+CMTI:` path never
  starts).  `serve` now sets `CMGF=1`, `CSCS="GSM"` and `CNMI=2,1,0,0,0` once
  and reports all three in its `state`.
* **MT works end to end.**  A message sent to SIM1 announced itself with
  `+CMTI: "SM",1`; the daemon read it between requests with `AT+CMGR=1` and a
  client saw sender, status, service-centre timestamp and body — the body
  arriving as UCS2 hex (`"6D4B8BD5"` = 测试) under `CSCS="GSM"`, which the
  daemon now decodes.  Reading moved the message to `REC READ` and nothing
  was deleted.
* **MO works over the plain AT channel; the long blockade was a bug in our
  own PDU, and the earlier "MO rides IMS" reading is withdrawn.**  The
  blockade looked like this: text-mode submit `+CMS ERROR: 313`; PDU mode
  `+CMS ERROR: 302` on two different subscriptions, national and
  international destinations alike — always with the CP registered on NR SA.
  The vendor's own submit, captured in the radio log as
  `RIL-AT: AT> 0001000B…<pdu>^Z` during a successful `IMS_SEND_SMS`, showed
  the difference: its first octet is **`0x01`** (no validity period), while
  our encoder wrote **`0x11`** (TP-VPF = relative), which promises a TP-VP
  octet the encoder did not carry — so the CP read every later field one slot
  off (DCS, UDL, body) and refused the result.  Everything else was already
  identical: SMSC length 0, the 11-digit national destination with TOA
  `0x81`, DCS `0x08` UCS2, and the user data.  With the first octet fixed the
  daemon's submit is accepted (`+CMGS: <mr>`, `OK`) and the message arrives
  at the recipient, verified end to end on a second subscription.  The
  `IMS_SEND_SMS` layer above is control glue: urild converts it into exactly
  this PDU-mode `CMGS` on the AT channel, so **no IMS client is needed for
  SMS on this generation** — and A5's MO half is done.
* **Registration needed the band recipe, again.**  With the RIL stopped the
  stack came up (`+CFUN: 1`) but would not register until the bands were
  locked to **LTE b1/b41 + NR n41/n78** *and* the `CFUN=0 → SFUN=2/4` cold
  cycle was run — on this unit, an unbounded NR scan (移动/广电 bands) hangs.
  The locks stayed in place for the rest of the session.

### 25.8 The internet, restored under our bearer (G3's AT half)

With the RIL stopped the handset had no data — expected, because nothing
re-establishes the bearer.  What the session established, all measured:

* **The RIL's teardown destroys the internet context.**  `AT+CGACT?` after the
  stop shows only cid 11 active, and `AT+CGCONTRDP=11` names it `ims` — the
  VoLTE context survives, the internet one does not.  (Its interface
  addresses linger on `sipa_eth0`, which reads as "up" and is a lie: a ping
  has no route.)
* **A fresh context works.**  `CGDCONT=1,"IPV4V6","cbnet"` → `CGACT=1,1` →
  `CGCONTRDP` (address 10.x/8, DNS 43.239.172.x) → `CGDATA="M-ETHER",1` →
  `CONNECT` — the same sequence the contracts §4.1 carries, on the 广电 card.
* **Android's policy routing kills unknown bearers, twice.**  Rule
  `32000: from all unreachable` swallows any packet whose lookup does not
  match an earlier table, so a main-table default is not enough; and the
  *return* path of a tethered client looks up the same tables after
  de-NAT.  The working recipe: default route in table **`legacy_system`**
  (matched at priority 18000 by unmarked traffic) *plus* the on-link subnets
  in that table (`10/8` via `sipa_eth0`, the hotspot's `192.168.43.0/24` via
  `wlan0`), so replies reach the client.
* **Tethering needs two more rules.**  `tetherctrl_FORWARD` carries a
  catch-all `DROP` and netd only inserts ACCEPT pairs for uplinks it knows —
  with the RIL stopped `sipa_eth0` is unknown, so 2670 client packets were
  dropped there.  `iptables -I tetherctrl_FORWARD` with the
  `wlan0 ↔ sipa_eth0` ACCEPT pair, plus `-t nat -A POSTROUTING -o sipa_eth0
  -j MASQUERADE`, and hotspot clients reached the internet.
* Client DNS still has to be set statically for now: DHCP advertises the
  upstream DNS netd knows, which is nothing.  All of these are runtime
  fixes; the permanent home is the daemon's `data up` plus the rootfs's own
  NAT (`e5_nat`) on the Linux side, which is the G3 acceptance itself.
## 26. Losing the management LAN: what actually started `systemd-networkd`, and who hands out the leases

Removing NetworkManager (commit `304385e`) looked like pure cleanup: every
device on the board is unmanaged, `apt-get -s remove network-manager` takes
only `network-manager`, `plasma-nm` and `plasma-welcome` with it, and the
desktop's network panel was its only remaining user.  The next boot came up
with no management LAN at all -- `usb0` with no address, the host left on a
self-assigned `169.254.x`, and nobody answering `192.168.77.1`.

`NetworkManager.service` is *disabled* in this image, and so is
`systemd-networkd`, and the overlay cannot ship enable symlinks (it travels
into the initramfs as plain files -- `boot/init` links `e5-bt-attach` and
`ufi-tools` by hand for exactly this reason).  What actually started networkd
was a drop-in that only looked like it was about NetworkManager:

    /etc/systemd/system/NetworkManager.service.d/50-e5-networkd.conf
    [Unit]
    Wants=systemd-networkd.service
    Wants=e5-telnetd.service

Deleting it with the package removed the last thing that started networkd, and
with it `usb0`'s `192.168.77.1` and its DHCP server.  Fixed in `b53aebe`:
`configure-rootfs.sh` enables `systemd-networkd{,.socket}` in the rootfs,
`device-finalize.sh` does the same on an installed device, and `boot/init`
links the unit into `multi-user.target.wants` at every boot for a device whose
rootfs predates that.

### The DHCP server that never starts

With networkd running, `usb0` got its address -- and the host still got no
lease, because networkd's own log says, every two minutes, forever:

    usb0: Failed to wait for the interface to be initialized: Connection timed out
    usb0: Failed
    usb0: Trying to reconfigure the interface.
    usb0: Configuring with /etc/systemd/network/10-e5-usb0.network.

The same rtnl timeouts hit `sipa_eth3`, `sipa_usb0` and `ip6_vti0`, so it is
the sprd SIPA pseudo-interfaces wedging networkd's netlink queue: the address
lands, the `DHCPServer=` that would have followed never starts.  The fix stops
asking networkd for DHCP at all (`168b405`).  `dnsmasq` serves *both* LANs --
which is what its own header already argued for the hotspot, that networkd's
DHCPServer can hand out addresses but cannot answer queries -- with
`bind-dynamic` (at boot only `usb0` exists; `wlan0` appears later with
hostapd) and tagged ranges, so `usb0` clients get `192.168.77.1` as their
resolver and *no* router option, while hotspot clients keep `192.168.9.1` for
both.

Verified on a cold boot of `work/boot-linux-slotb-cpd11.img`, from the
device's own journal, and on the host with the port back on "using DHCP":

    dnsmasq-dhcp[5361]: DHCPDISCOVER(usb0) 02:50:00:00:e5:02
    dnsmasq-dhcp[5361]: DHCPOFFER(usb0) 192.168.77.21 02:50:00:00:e5:02
    dnsmasq-dhcp[5361]: DHCPACK(usb0) 192.168.77.21 02:50:00:00:e5:02

`en8` had `192.168.77.21` about twelve seconds after the device appeared.

### The escape hatch: the gadget's other half

With no address anywhere there is still the serial console.  The same USB
gadget that carries the NCM netdev also exposes a CDC-ACM port, macOS names it
`/dev/cu.usbmodemE5LINUX3`, and `serial-getty@ttyGS0` is listening on it:
`root`/`root` gets a shell, and `systemctl enable --now systemd-networkd`
brings the LAN back from there.  `tools/e5-serial.sh` drives that port from
the host:

    tools/e5-serial.sh 'ip -br addr show usb0; systemctl is-active systemd-networkd'

Two things about it are worth remembering.  The agent's own shell cannot open
`/dev` nodes ("Operation not permitted"), so this is a step the human has to
run.  And `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` only exists while the gadget is bound: after the
UDC was lost the host saw neither half of the device, and a power cycle -- not
a replug -- was what brought it back.  In the case that cost the most time it was the host port being switched from a hand-set address to DHCP that lost the path; the gadget itself was fine.

### Two red herrings from the same boot

Both looked like password problems and were not.  `passwd -S e5` said `P` the
whole time.  And the greeter appeared because the *autologin session died*,
not because the password was wrong:

    sddm-helper[5304]: pam_systemd(sddm-autologin:session): Failed to create session: Connection timed out

-- the same family of timeouts, this time inside logind while udev was still
absorbing the boot's device flood.  The next boot logged `Authentication for
user "e5" successful` and the session stayed on seat0.
## 27. Two sessions, one working: SDDM, the renderer, and a profile that was not readable

The phosh desktop did not come up for a day, and the cause was three things stacked.

First the login: the e5 password in the deployed rootfs did not match the one being
typed, so SDDM's autologin failed and SDDM fell back to its greeter -- and the Wayland
greeter cannot draw on this image (it wants kwin_wayland, which left with KDE), which
looks exactly like a black screen with a working backlight.

Then a wrong turn of mine: reading that as "SDDM is unusable", I replaced it with an
autologin on tty1.  That path does not carry the env line the image's own
phosh.desktop has -- Exec=env WLR_RENDERER=gles2 phosh-session -- and without it phoc
spins at 90% CPU: the session never reaches the UI, and the physical keys look dead.
They are not: a raw capture of /dev/input/event2 shows the keypad reporting KP_ENTER,
BACK plus BACKSPACE, digits and DOWN the whole time; nothing was consuming them.
(The profile pins gles2 against a stray WLR_RENDERER=pixman in /etc/environment, which
is worse still.  Removing the line makes the session not start at all -- verified both
ways.)

Third, and invisible: /home/e5/.bash_profile arrived from the overlay as 0600 root:root,
so the login shell stopped at the permission check and exited without a word.  cpio
records the packing host's modes and uid; boot/init now chowns /home/e5 back to e5.

With the password reset, the ownership fixed and the no-display-manager change reverted,
SDDM autologins into phosh and touch, the physical keys and phosh-osk-stub (the on-screen
keyboard) all work.  The X11 greeter works too, since X is installed -- anyone who wants
a login screen only has to clear Autologin/User.

## 28. Traps from the work log

Moved here from `docs/STATUS.md` when its dated sections were cleared; each one cost
at least a session.

* **The initramfs overlay is baked into the flashed image and wins on every boot.**
  `boot/init` copies `e5-overlay/` over the root filesystem each time, so a file pushed
  onto the device by hand is reverted by the next reboot if the *flashed* image carries
  an older copy (files the image does not carry at all survive).  That is how the
  hotspot came back on 2.4 GHz channel 6, how the device's `sddm.conf.d` kept naming
  `plasma-mobile.desktop`, and how a power-key drop-in "disappeared".  Edit
  `rootfs/overlay/`, rebuild with `boot/build-boot-image.py --overlay rootfs/overlay`,
  flash.  (`/var/lib/*` is the exception since 2026-09-25: it is state, so the overlay
  only seeds it when the file is missing -- UFI-TOOLS' token lives there.)  The copy is `find -type f`: symlinks in the overlay are dropped, so a
  `/dev/null` mask has to be a regular shadow unit instead.
* **`systemctl restart sddm` takes the screen away until a reboot.**  SDDM's default
  `DisplayServer` is x11; with no `/usr/bin/X` it retries three times, fails, and
  exports `DISPLAY=:0` into the session, so phosh exits with `cannot open display: :0`
  and `mobi.phosh.Shell.service` hits "Start request repeated too quickly".
  `DisplayServer=wayland` in `etc/sddm.conf.d/10-e5.conf` is the fix; a reboot is the
  recovery.
* **Both boot slots once held Linux images.**  `boot_a` had been overwritten with a
  Linux image, so every "back to Android" landed in Linux again (LK still logs
  `ANDROID: Booting slot_a`).  Before arming slot b, check that `boot_a` hashes to the
  stock Android image.
* **A reconnect storm got the IoT SIM barred (2026-09-18).**  After a network-side
  detach (`+CGEV: NW DETACH`, `+SPERROR: 14,27`), `e5-mobile-data`
  (`Restart=on-failure`) and its watcher (`Restart=always`, 15 s) retried the bring-up
  continuously -- `SFUN=2/4`, `CEREG` polls, `CGACT` -- amplified by `sim-reset`
  (`SFUN=5/3`) and manual pokes.  The card was then refused on Android too
  (emergency only, healthy LTE cell, `PS is rejected`).  A guard was written that night
  (5 failures in 30 min, watcher backoff 60 s -> 30 min, no `Restart=` on the data
  unit, no `SFUN=5/3` in `sim-reset`, which left the SIM undetected until a reboot) --
  and the 2026-09-19 straight port of mu300's `mobile-data` dropped it on purpose.
  **The current tree has no storm guard**: `e5-mobile-data.service` is
  `Restart=on-failure` and `sim-reset` sends `SFUN=5/3` again.  `unisoc-cpd`
  (section 25) is meant to own the bearer instead.  Lifting a bar is the operator's
  call.
* **`btattach` holds up shutdown.**  It ignores SIGTERM and outlived the final
  SIGKILL; `e5-bt-attach.service` has `KillSignal=SIGKILL` + `TimeoutStopSec=2`, and a
  `system.conf.d` drop-in caps `DefaultTimeoutStopSec` at 5 s so a watchdog reboot
  never waits on vendor teardown.
* **From Android, arm slot b and reset with sysrq** (24.5): a clean `adb reboot` lets
  Android's init rewrite the A/B metadata back to slot a.
* **ADB on the Linux side was tried and taken back out (2026-09-18).**  What the
  attempt established: configfs accepts a new function (`functions/ffs.adb` and its
  link into `configs/c.1/`) while the gadget is bound, but a FunctionFS function cannot
  be *bound* until a daemon holds its `ep0` -- adding `ffs.adb` to the boot-time gadget
  makes the composite bind fail and the board loses USB entirely, network and console
  alike.  The working order is add function, mount FunctionFS, start `adbd`, and only
  then (re)bind; and an explicit `echo '' > UDC` + rebind twice left the gadget
  half-configured (ACM back, NCM gone) until a power cycle, which is why
  `e5-gadget-guard` rebinds only an *empty* UDC.  Telnet on the management LAN and the
  serial console are the ways in instead (section 26).  Two side lessons from the same
  day: an overlay script's mode is the mode git records (`git add --chmod=+x`, or
  `status=203/EXEC`), and `After=network.target` on the hotspot plus
  `Before=network.target` on the unit it wanted made a `Transaction order is cyclic`.
* **One bridge for the USB LAN and the hotspot cost a day and was reverted
  (2026-09-21).**  br0 on 192.168.9.0/24 with usb0 and the AP as ports is right on paper,
  but it stacked two layers that fail silently on this SoC: systemd-networkd's rtnl
  requests time out against the sprd pseudo-interfaces, leaving br0 an empty shell (no
  ports, no address, no DHCP); and hostapd's `bridge=br0` places the AP port only if
  the bridge already exists -- otherwise the AP serves clients that never get a lease.
  An interface hostapd owns cannot be enslaved afterwards (silently refused), and `iw`
  cannot change the type of an enslaved interface ("Interface wlan0 wasn't started").
  Two LANs it is: usb0 192.168.77.1, wlan0 192.168.9.1.  The revert missed three
  bridge-only comments and the bounded `systemctl restart systemd-networkd/dnsmasq`
  step in `hotspot-start.sh`, and trimmed the dnsmasq/networkd comments; the history
  cleanup of 2026-09-25 put all of that back to the pre-bridge state.  (The bridge
  came back on 2026-09-26 built the other way round -- section 31.)

## 29. "High load at boot": what the number was made of (2026-09-25)

The load average read 8.8 one minute after boot and never went below 6, which looked
like a busy system and matched the session feeling sluggish.  It was three separate
things, and only one of them was CPU.

**The floor of 6 was accounting.**  A five-second `/proc/stat` delta was 99.4 % idle
and `/proc/pressure/cpu` read 0.06 %, while six vendor kernel threads sat permanently
in `D` (uninterruptible sleep), each of which counts in the load average:

| thread | wait | module |
|---|---|---|
| `sdiohal_tx_thread`, `sdiohal_rx_thread` | `wait_for_completion()` | `wcn_bsp` |
| `pub_int_handle_thread` | `wait_for_completion()` | `wcn_bsp` |
| `62110080.time_sync_ch` | `TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE` + `schedule()` | `sprd_time_sync_ch` |
| `slog-0-0` | `msleep(2000)` until `log_transport`, which nothing on Linux sets | `slog_bridge` |
| `agdsp_access` | `msleep(200)` in a retry loop | `agdsp_pd` |

`kernel/patches/0015` puts the first five to sleep the way idle kernel threads should
(interruptible completions -- kernel threads ignore every signal, so nothing else
changes -- `TASK_IDLE`, `msleep_interruptible()`).  The sixth was ours: 0010 had
taught `agdsp_access_init_thread()` to retry `smsg_ch_open()` on `-ENODEV`, on the
theory that the audio SIPC target did not exist *yet*.  It never exists:
`agdsp_pd_probe()` initialises `dst = 0, channel = 0` and never reads either from the
DT, and SIPC target 0 is the AP itself.  The vendor code logs one `Failed to open
channel 0,dst=0,rval=-19` and lets the thread end; audio works without it (it did all
along, with the thread spinning).  The retry is gone from 0010.

**The console cost real time.**  The bootloader's command line is Android's
(`console=ttyS1,115200n8`, `initcall_debug=1`, `rcupdate.rcu_expedited=1`, ...), our
`console=`/`loglevel=` do not survive into it, and `boot/init` set the console level
to 7.  printk writes to the console synchronously in whoever printed:

    console level 7:  10.3 ms per info line (200 lines to /dev/kmsg, timed)
    console level 4:  ~0

and `sprd_drm` prints three info lines on every atomic commit (3371 of the 7282 lines
in the first nine minutes), so each phoc screen update stalled ~30 ms in the kernel;
the Wi-Fi driver logs per ARP/DNS packet.  `etc/sysctl.d/10-e5-printk.conf` sets
`kernel.printk = 4 4 1 7` once the real root is up (the initramfs keeps 7, where the
serial console is the only witness).  The ring buffer, the journal and pstore's panic
dump keep every level.  `rcu_expedited` stayed 1 for the life of the system -- every
`synchronize_rcu()` an IPI to all eight cores -- and `etc/tmpfiles.d/e5-rcu.conf`
turns it off once userspace is up.

**The worst boots also lost Wi-Fi, and that was the loop device.**  `hotspot-start.sh`
still attached `/lib/firmware/wcnmodem.bin` to a read-write loop device for the DT's
`/dev/block/by-name/wcnmodem`, although 8.3 had already shown the loader is the real
path.  The driver's partition reader is compiled out altogether
(`FIRMWARE_PARTITION_DEBUG_EN` is never defined, so `btwf_load_firmware_data()` returns
NULL), and a read-write loop over the file makes `request_firmware()` fail with
`ETXTBSY`:

    loading /lib/firmware/wcnmodem.bin failed with error -26
    marlin_download_from_partition buff is NULL
    marlin download timeout ... sprd-wlan: failed to power on WCN!

After one failure `is_btwf_in_sysfs` is set for the rest of the boot (the same sticky
flag as GNSS in 8.3), so a WCN power-on that landed after the `losetup` -- usually
Bluetooth's -- cost Wi-Fi until the next reboot, with hostapd retrying into its start
timeout and dragging `user@1000` and networkd-wait-online down with it.  Two boots out
of three that day did it.  The loop device is gone.

Measured on the image with all of it (load2):

    before:  load 8.8 at 1 min, 6.2 at 10 min; userspace 42.0 s; 6 threads in D
    after:   load 3.5 at 1 min, 0.64 at 4 min; userspace 25.1 s; none in D;
             no failed units, hotspot up, zero WCN download failures

## 30. A CP reset nobody recovered from, and IPv6 for the hotspot (2026-09-26)

(The 300 s wait for the dump: answered by `e5-modemd` since 2026-09-28, section 47.6.)

**The CP asserts, and the device stays offline.**  At 00:24:11 the modem firmware
asserted on its own -- `/var/log/e5-android-log.txt` (modem_control's log through
`logdw.py`):

    Modem Assert: LASM Task  PS CP assert in file PS/sdi/common/msg/sdi_msg_iram.c
    line 98 exp=MM Task 's Q full info=[], [dfs=5]

One assert in that log, which spans every boot since 22:32 the day before; what
filled the MM task's queue is not known (the unisoc-cpd page and UFI-TOOLS were both
polling at the time -- correlation, not a cause).  What followed is ours:

1. `modem_control` waits for "dump complete" before it resets the CP, which on
   Android the CP log daemon sends.  Nothing on Linux does, so every assert costs its
   full 300 s timeout (00:24:11 -> 00:29:11 `Modem Reset`).
2. The CP comes back at `+CFUN: 0` with no context.  Android's RIL turns the radio
   on after a reset; `e5-bearer-up` did one pass at boot and was done, so the device
   stayed offline with a stale IPv4 address on `sipa_eth0`.
3. `unisoc-cpd data up` flushes `sipa_eth0` before it adds the IPv4 address, which
   also removes the link-local.  With no link-local the kernel sends no router
   solicitation, so after any re-bring-up IPv6 was gone until the next boot.

`e5-bearer-watch.timer` now looks once a minute -- one `AT+CGACT?`, the CP is
sensitive to AT volume (25.3) -- and restarts `e5-bearer-up` when context 1 is not
active; the retrying stays in that unit.  Tested by dropping the context by hand
(`AT+CGACT=0,1`): bearer, new IPv4 address and new IPv6 prefix back within a
minute.  The 300 s dump wait is still there.

**IPv6 pass-through.**  The context is `IPV4V6` (`AT+CGDCONT`), and the network side
is the 3GPP arrangement: `+CGPADDR` carries only an interface identifier (upper 64
bits zero), and the RA on `sipa_eth0` has the prefix **autonomous but not on-link**
-- no `/64 dev sipa_eth0` route, the interface is NOARP ("Device does not do
neighbour discovery"), and the whole /64 is routed to the UE.  So it can be moved to
one downstream link without any NDP proxy (a /64 can only be on one link; the
hotspot gets it, usb0 does not).  `opt/e5/e5-ipv6-share`:

* `accept_ra=2` on the uplink: with `net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1` the kernel
  ignores RAs on `accept_ra=1` interfaces, and turning forwarding on at runtime also
  purges the RA-learned default router (the carrier's unsolicited RAs are hours
  apart, so the script re-solicits by re-adding the link-local when there is no
  default route);
* the uplink link-local from the `+CGPADDR` interface identifier;
* `<prefix>::1/64` on wlan0, dropping the prefix of an earlier bearer.

dnsmasq advertises it (`constructor:wlan0,ra-stateless`), RDNSS pointing at the
global `::1` (`option6:dns-server,[::]` -- without it dnsmasq advertised its
link-local); decoded from a solicitation on wlan0: `prefix/64 L=1 A=1 valid 3600`,
`MTU 1500`, `RDNSS <prefix>::1`.  `table inet e5fw6` is a home-router firewall:
replies and the ICMPv6 PMTU/diagnostics need come in, new inbound connections from
`sipa_eth*` are dropped.

Checked with a client simulated in a network namespace at `<prefix>::c1`: ping and a
725 KB HTTP download over IPv6 from that address -- the carrier delivers traffic for
any address in the /64, not only the device's own.  A real Wi-Fi client has not been
tried yet.

## 31. One LAN after all: br0 for the USB port and the hotspot (2026-09-26)

Two reasons to merge them: one subnet (a laptop on the cable and a phone on the
Wi-Fi without routing between them), and IPv6 -- the bearer's /64 can only live on
one link (section 30), so with two LANs the USB host had none.  The 2026-09-21
attempt failed on two silent layers (28); this one avoids both:

* **networkd builds nothing.**  `opt/e5/net-bridge.sh` (`e5-net-bridge.service`,
  before `network.target`, dnsmasq, the hotspot and the management services) makes
  `br0` with `ip`, gives it usb0's fixed MAC, 192.168.9.1/24 and -- as a second
  address -- 192.168.77.1 (the initramfs's rescue subnet, so a host still holding
  that lease keeps working), and enslaves usb0.  Both `.network` files are now
  `Unmanaged=yes` (kept rather than deleted: an overlay file that disappears stays on
  the device), and `systemd-networkd-wait-online` is a no-op, since it would only
  wait out its two minutes for links nobody manages.
* **hostapd gets br0 ready-made.**  `bridge=br0` in both configs; `hotspot-start.sh`
  waits for `br0/brif/usb0`, takes wlan0 out of the bridge before the `__ap` type
  change, and counts the hotspot as up only when `br0/brif/wlan0` exists.

dnsmasq serves only br0: pool .10-.200, `dhcp-authoritative` (NAKs the old
192.168.77.x lease at renewal), and the USB host -- the gadget's fixed host MAC
`02:50:00:00:e5:02` -- always gets 192.168.9.2 with the router option empty, so a
laptop keeps its own default route (verified: IPv4 default stays on the Mac's own
interface, IPv6 via the device; this gateway suppression was removed on
2026-10-02 after the USB IPv4 report, see §56). `e5-ipv6-share` puts the /64 on br0, so the RA
reaches both ports.

**The price of one L2: the management services see the hotspot.**  They already
listened on every address (telnet `root/root` on `*:23`, UFI-TOOLS, gotty) -- and,
once the uplink had a public IPv6 address, on the internet too.  Two tables in
`etc/e5/nat.nft`:

    table inet e5in       input from sipa_eth*: established/related and ICMP only
    table bridge e5mgmt   input from the wlan0 port: tcp 23, 1146, 2333, 7887 dropped

The bridge-family table is what tells the ports apart; the IP layer cannot.  Tested
from a veth port in a namespace with the same rule: 23, 2333, 7887 blocked, DNS and
forwarding to the internet unaffected.

**Trap: never take usb0 down.**  To make the host renew its lease the first time,
usb0 was set down and up on the device.  The NCM function lost its framing with the
host -- every frame from then on `configfs-gadget gadget: Wrong NTH SIGN`, counters
frozen, ARP incomplete -- and only a reboot brought it back (a re-plug would do too).
Enslaving usb0 and moving addresses on and off it live are harmless; the serial
console (ACM on the same gadget) survived and was the way back.  A second trap from
the same day, already in 28: `net-bridge.sh` was created without the executable bit,
and the first boot with it came up with no bridge (`status=203/EXEC`).

Clean boot on br2: no failed unit, userspace 21.5 s (25.1 s before -- wait-online),
br0 = usb0 + wlan0 with the public /64, the Mac at 192.168.9.2 with IPv6.

## 32. An audio DMA read that rebooted the device into Android (2026-09-26)

After 5 h 50 min of an idle desktop the device rebooted and came up in Android.
Nothing had been asked of it -- the last commands were read-only AT queries.
pstore held the record (`dmesg-ramoops-0.enc.z`, raw deflate):

    Internal error: synchronous external abort [#1]      CPU4, data-loop.0 (PipeWire)
    pc : readl
    sprd_dma_tx_status <- sprd_pcm_pointer [sprd_dmaengine_pcm] <- soc_pcm_pointer
      <- snd_pcm_update_hw_ptr0 <- snd_pcm_hwsync <- snd_pcm_sync_ptr (ioctl)

The PCM position is the live address register of a DMA channel in the AGCP domain,
and reading it while the AP has no access to that domain is a bus error, not an error
code.  The stream was open (`sprd_pcm_open` holds the domain's runtime-PM reference
for every FE but voice/FM/HFP, FE_ST_FAST included), no system suspend was logged,
and nothing in the 64 KB before the oops touched audio -- so what took the access away
is still not known.  What is known is what makes it fatal: `sprd_pcm_pointer()` is
called continuously and never asks.

`kernel/patches/0016`: it asks `agdsp_can_access()` first.  That is the vendor's own
check, exported by agdsp_pd, and it reads only always-on registers -- the AP access
enable (`ap_access_ena` = AON APB `0x14c` mask `0x20`, i.e. 0x6490014c bit 5), AGCP
deep sleep and the AGCP system/DSP power states in PMU APB (`0x850`, `0x860`,
`0x544`) -- so it is safe to call at any time.  Without access the position is held
at its last value; the event is logged rate-limited ("AGCP not accessible"), which is
the trace to look for if it happens again.  The check's own messages are rate-limited
too, since it now runs on every position query.

**Why a panic lands in Android, while a reboot does not.**  The bootloader log after
the crash: `panic type boot count 6`, a sysdump written to `sysdumpdb`, then
`bootable slot 1 ... tries_remaining: 1` and `check rollback slot 1 tries: 1 ->
Booting slot_a`.  A panic makes LK run a sysdump boot first, and that boot uses one of
slot b's two tries, so the real boot finds one left and rolls back.  An ordinary
`systemctl reboot` keeps Linux.  (`boot/init` sets `panic_on_oops=1` on purpose, so
this is the designed fallback, not a fault of its own.)

Trap from the same recovery: `(sleep 2; systemctl reboot) &` over the telnet helper
never reboots -- the job dies with the session.  Run `systemctl reboot` in the
foreground and let the connection drop.

## 33. Microphone, earpiece and Bluetooth, from the device's own Android (2026-09-26)

One Android boot supplied the references (kept in `work/android-ref/`, not in the
repo): the HAL route table `/odm/etc/audio_route.xml`, the parameter XMLs, the eight
`/odm/firmware/bt_configure_*.ini`, a btsnoop log and the vendor HAL's logcat.

### 33.1 Capture: two routing controls nobody had set

With the codec side alone (mic, bias, PGA, ADC switches) both capture front ends
streamed and returned `EIO`: the DMA never moved.  The route table's
`be_switch/codec_c` and `vbc_iis_mux/only_codec_c` add what was missing --
`ag_iis1_ext_sel_v2 = aud_4ad_iis0_ad0` (the codec ADC into the AGCP's IIS1) and
`VBC_MUX_ADC0/1/2_IIS_PORT_SEL`; with them FE_CAPTURE_DSP (hw:N,2) delivers.
`devices/main_mic` sets `ADD0_DATA_MIC13` and inverts the ADC LRCLK: in stereo MIC1 is
the left channel and the right one is the unpowered MIC3 ADC pinned at -32768 (the
pinned channel moves with the LRCLK setting, which is how that was told apart); a mono
open returns MIC1 alone.  Gains from `audio_params/sprd`: ADC 6
(`adc1_capture_volume`), VBC ADC0 DG 0x11 (`Music/Handsfree/Record`).

The DSP capture scene writes 16-bit samples whatever hw_params say: opened `S24_LE`
-- which PipeWire picks when the DAI offers it -- each 32-bit word held two samples
(`0xf9530021`) and the recording was noise at -0.5 dBFS.  `kernel/patches/0017` offers
S16_LE only.  Result: an "Internal Microphone" PipeWire source (mono, S16) with a
plausible level.  A speaker-to-mic tone never showed up in the capture, noise did --
not echo cancellation, as first assumed, but a speaker that was not playing (34); with
34 fixed the tone comes back from the mic at its own frequency, and recording voice
with GNOME Sound Recorder works (confirmed 2026-09-26).  The AP capture FE (hw:N,0)
still stalls after one period.

### 33.2 Earpiece

`devices/handset`: the receiver hangs off the HPL driver (`HPL EAR Sel = EAR`,
`EAR_HPL Mixer DACHPL`, `Earpiece Function`, `VBC_MIXER1_DAC0 = HALF_ADD`,
`DAHP OS D = 5`).  As a UCM device conflicting with Speaker the EAR/RCV DAPM path
powers up during playback and the aw87xxx goes Off.  Not yet confirmed by ear.

### 33.3 Bluetooth: the vendor configuration the HAL sends first

The btsnoop log starts at HCI Reset; the vendor HAL (`bt_chip_vendor`,
`marlin3_lite`, chip id `2/Marlin3Lite_AB_0x2355B001/1`, which selects the `.xpe.ini`
pair) sends before it, and only logcat and the kernel's mtty dumps show it:

    0xfca0  pskey, 176 bytes   (answer: firmware node 5256, 2015-04-26)
    0xfca2  RF, 252 bytes
    0xfca1  00 00 01           core enable
    0xfcb0/1/2                 super-SSP enable and keys (not reproduced)

The payloads are the ini fields little-endian in file order, each value L/values bytes
per `/L=` block (rf.ini's BR/EDR channel powers share one block), zero-padded; the
pskey carries the factory address from `/mnt/vendor/btmac.txt`.
`tools/sprd-bt-config.py` rebuilds them byte for byte against the logged prefixes.
Linux's btattach sent none of it, which is why the controller had a placeholder
address and manufacturer 0.

A userspace prototype (send the three, then attach the same fd to N_HCI) proved it:
factory address, manufacturer 0x01ec, scans work.  The native form is
`kernel/patches/0018`: hci_uart's setup recognises the `ttyBT` transport and sends them,
payloads via `request_firmware` (`sprd/marlin3lite_{pskey,rf}.bin`, written into the
overlay by `pull-wcn-firmware.sh`).  hci_uart is built in, so this is the first Image
since 0009 (`work/Image-bt1`, sha256 `03787d59...`; `#4`).  The stock btattach is
unchanged.  Pairing and audio profiles are not tested yet.

Trap from the prototype: `HCIUARTSETPROTO`/`HCIUARTSETFLAGS` take their argument by
value; passed a pointer (Python's `fcntl.ioctl(fd, op, struct.pack(...))`) they fail
with `EPROTONOSUPPORT`/`EINVAL`.

## 34. The speaker after the first sound: three faults on one path (2026-09-26)

Reported as "the Settings sound test is silent".  It was three independent faults, each
hiding the next; the mic (33) turned out to be the best instrument -- a 440 Hz tone
played through PipeWire and recorded through the mic, with a Goertzel scan over the
recording, tells silent, stalled and wrong-pitch apart without anyone listening.

### 34.1 The codec probed against dummy regulators

Every playback in every boot of the journal logged `daaor_en_event check cal_done
failed -110`, and `ANA_CDC7` (codec analog + 0x90, readable in
`/proc/asound/card0/sprd-codec`, "analog part" row 0x0090) stayed 0 where Android
reads 0x000f: the AO buffer DC calibration never completed.  The boot log said why:

    23.06  sprd-codec-ump9620 ...: supply VB / BIAS / HEADMICBIAS / DAHPL_CHN not found,
           using dummy regulator
    25.51  snd_soc_sprd_codec_ump9620_power, _power_dev loaded (by e5-audio-dsp)

udev autoloads the codec by modalias; the codec power regulators (`SRG_*`, instantiated
by `-power-dev`, which has no modalias of its own) come 2.5 s later.  The calibration
enables `DAHPL_CHN` around its poll, and a dummy enables nothing.  Fix, in the native
place: `rootfs/overlay/etc/modprobe.d/e5-audio.conf`, a `softdep ... pre:` on the codec
for both power modules.  After it the codec holds `SRG_DAHPL_CHN`, the calibration
passes and `ANA_CDC7` reads 0x000f while playing.

Reading the PMIC regmap for this: `/sys/kernel/debug/regmap/spi4.0/registers` is slow
(each line is an ADI read; a grep for one register took minutes), but it seeks: lines
are 15 bytes, so `dd bs=15 skip=$((reg/4)) count=1` reads one register at once.  The
codec's analog block sits at regmap 0x1000 there (the driver's 0x3000 "AGCP" base is
remapped).

### 34.2 FE_FAST_P plays one S24 stream, then stalls

With calibration fixed the first sound after boot was heard, nothing after it: every
later `pw-play`, Amberol or Settings stream hung with the Speaker node running at
quantum 0.  The PCM position (`echo "debug_pointer_log 1" >
/proc/asound/card0/sprd-dmaengine`) sat at 0x5a0 from the start of the stream.  The AGCP
DMA channel was enabled with request line 9 pending-enabled and never requested; its
destination, 0x56500010, is the MCDT, not the VBC -- FAST_P goes AP DMA -> MCDT DAC4 ->
DSP.  MCDT `DAC4_FIFO_ADDR_ST` (0x565000f4) read 0x02E00048 in a good stream (both
pointers moving) and 0x00000168 in a stalled one: 0x168 words = 1440 bytes written, read
pointer 0 -- the DSP never read the FIFO.

The AP side was identical in both (same open/hw_params/trigger/SIPC sequence, same MCDT
and DMA setup, same timing), and neither re-sending the per-stream controls Android
sends (`KCTL_SET` MDG/DG, the profile select) nor the UCM route revived it.  Raw
`aplay` isolated it: S16 streams restart every time (8/8, gaps 0-20 s); after an S24
(`VBC_DAT_L24`) stream the next one stalls whatever its format, and it takes one or two
stalled streams to clear.  PipeWire opened S24_32, so it stalled from its second
stream on.  Android's HAL opens this FE S16 only (`data_fmt=VBC_DAT_L16` in its
dmesg).  `kernel/patches/0019`: FE_FAST_P offers S16_LE only.

### 34.3 PipeWire took the planar layout

Now streams ran, and music sounded "strange": the mic heard 880 Hz for a 440 Hz tone,
with a level spike per period, while raw interleaved `aplay` came back at 440 Hz.
`pw-top` showed `S16P` -- planar.  `sprd_pcm_hardware_v1` advertises
`SNDRV_PCM_INFO_NONINTERLEAVED` for every FE (the AP FEs split left/right over two DMA
channels), but for an MCDT FE `sprd_pcm_hw_params()` forces one channel, so a planar
buffer is played as interleaved frames: each plane twice as fast.  The 24-bit format
had hidden this, since PipeWire only goes planar where it can.
`kernel/patches/0020`: a startup callback constrains the MCDT FEs (the ids
`mcdt_dma_config_init()` handles) to interleaved access.  Result: `S16LE 2 48000`,
the tone back at 440 Hz three streams in a row, each 4 s file done in 4.2 s.

Trap from this session: `busybox devmem` on an AGCP register (MCDT, DMA) while the
domain is not accessible is the same synchronous external abort as 32 -- it rebooted
the device into Android once.  Only read those while a stream is running, or use the
driver's own dumps (`/proc/asound/card0/{vbc,sprd-codec}`, `debug_pointer_log`).

## 35. Wi-Fi under NetworkManager, the hotspot as a bridge port, and the 30 s BT close (2026-09-26)

Plan A of the Phosh integration: NetworkManager owns `wlan0` -- station mode from
Phosh's Wi-Fi menu and the hotspot -- and nothing else.  The LAN (`br0` = `usb0` +
the AP, 192.168.9.1/24) stays with `e5-net-bridge`, the bearer with `e5-bearer-up`
and `unisoc-cpd`, DHCP/DNS/RA with dnsmasq, filtering with `nat.nft`.  hostapd,
`e5-hotspot`, its retry timer and `hotspot-start.sh` are retired.

### 35.1 NetworkManager confined to wlan0

`etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/50-e5.conf`: `unmanaged-devices=*,except:interface-name:
wlan0,except:interface-name:br0`, `dns=none`/`rc-manager=unmanaged` (resolv.conf is
the bearer's), connectivity checks off, no default wired profiles.  `br0` is left
managed on purpose: NM finds it configured by someone else and runs it as
"connected (externally)" -- its addresses untouched -- which is what lets NM attach
the AP to it.  That also answers the old NM trouble (FINDINGS 26): it never sees
`sipa_dummy0`, and `NetworkManager-wait-online` is a no-op drop-in anyway.  Started
live behind a dead-man switch (roll back to hostapd unless confirmed within 60 s);
the USB link never blinked.

### 35.2 The hotspot profile

`Hotspot` (`usr/lib/NetworkManager/system-connections/Hotspot.nmconnection`): mode
`ap`, SSID `E5-Linux`, WPA2-PSK, `master=br0`/`slave-type=bridge`, no IP settings --
NM passes the bridge to wpa_supplicant, so EAPOL is handled on the port the way
hostapd's `bridge=br0` did.  Three details it took:

* **Channel 149 at 80 MHz needs a patched NetworkManager.**  At 80 MHz
  wpa_supplicant failed the AP after its HT scan ("Interface initialization
  failed"); its debug log said `VHT seg0 index 154` for channel 149.  The centre
  comes from NetworkManager: `get_ap_params()` in 1.52 computes `((ch/4 - 1)/4)*16 +
  10`, right for 36-144 and one off for 149-161 (154, should be 155).  Upstream fixed
  it in 2026 (`5763b9b4`, `a0e03b12`, "supplicant: fix center channel calculation");
  trixie has 1.52.1.  153/161 "started" with the same bogus centre.  Channel 36 at
  80 MHz came up with the stock package (`cf1=5210`), but no phone ever associated --
  nothing reached the driver or wpa_supplicant, as if it was not on the air -- while
  149 is what hostapd and stock Android use.  So the fix is carried instead:
  `rootfs/deb-patches/network-manager-vht80-center.patch` (the upstream table),
  built into Debian's own source package by `rootfs/build-patched-debs.sh` (a
  `debian:trixie` arm64 container, version `1.52.1-1+e51`), installed and held by
  `install-packages.sh`.  With it: `VHT seg0 index 155`, `cf1=5775 MHz`,
  AP-ENABLED.  `keyfile` wants `channel-width=80` (an integer), not `80mhz`.
* **Phones saw the AP and could not join: WPS.**  Nothing reached wpa_supplicant
  or the driver -- this driver associates in firmware (`device_ap_sme=1`), and the
  firmware turned every station away.  The same radio, channel and bridge under
  the old hostapd config let the phone straight in, so the two AP setups were
  diffed from their `-dd` logs.  wpa_supplicant's AP mode had added a **WPS
  element** to the beacon, probe response and association response
  (`beacon_ies`/`proberesp_ies`/`assocresp_ies` = `dd .. 00 50 f2 04 ...`), which
  hostapd never sends; it also left out the Country element and advertised every
  HT/VHT hardware flag (VHT cap 0x01b07031 against hostapd's 0x00000020).
  `wps-method=1` (disabled) in the profile makes NM pass `wps_disabled=1`; with
  that alone the phone associated (`AP-STA-CONNECTED`, handshake completed, DHCP
  192.168.9.41 on br0).  Also found on the way: NM 1.52 (and upstream main)
  appends `WPA-PSK-SHA256` to an AP's key_mgmt whenever wpa_supplicant can do PMF,
  even with PMF disabled -- AKM 00-0F-AC:6 without MFPC (`key_mgmt_suites=0x102`).
  `network-manager-02-ap-psk-sha256.patch` limits such an AP to WPA-PSK (`0x2`, as
  hostapd).  It was not what made the phone join -- that was WPS, tested after it
  -- and is kept because that RSN element is invalid.  (The package is
  `1.52.1-1+e5.2`, the suffix counting the patches.)
* **Read-only in /usr/lib.**  The overlay is copied over `/etc` at every boot, so a
  profile there would lose every SSID/password change.  NM treats
  `/usr/lib/NetworkManager/system-connections` as read-only and writes an edited
  profile to `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections`, which shadows it and is not
  in the overlay.  `boot/init` chmods the shipped keyfile 0600: the image builder
  packs every overlay file a+r, and NM ignores a keyfile others can read.
* **Up at boot.**  `autoconnect=true`, like the hostapd hotspot; with equal
  priority NM restores whichever of the hotspot and a joined network was used last,
  and its autoconnect retries replace the retry timer for the WCN's refused first
  beacon.

UFI-TOOLS drives the same profile through `nmcli` (`control.py`): status, up/down,
SSID/PSK/auth/channel/hidden via `connection modify` (an active hotspot is brought
up again), and the MAC allow/deny list -- which NM's AP mode lacks -- as an nftables
bridge filter on frames entering from `wlan0` (`table bridge e5acl`, reloaded at
start-up).  Two UFI-TOOLS bugs surfaced on the way: the web UI sends the password
base64-encoded and the backend had stored that string as the passphrase, and the
"broadcast SSID" box was inverted on save.

**Phosh's switch.**  Phosh (0.46 and main) starts the first AP-mode profile from its
hotspot switch -- ours -- but `is_active_connection_hotspot_master()` only counts an
active connection with `ipv4.method=shared`.  A bridge port has no IP settings, so
the switch reads off while the hotspot runs and cannot stop it.  Not solved here.

### 35.3 The 21 s shutdown was the BT core, not NetworkManager

With NM, a reboot sat 21 s in "NetworkManager/wpa_supplicant: State 'final-sigterm'
timed out ... Processes still around after final SIGKILL" -- both in the kernel.
The WCN log had the chain: bluetoothd exits, btattach closes `ttyBT` ->
`stop_marlin [MARLIN_BLUETOOTH]` -> `MEM_PD: marlin bt state:1` and nothing more;
then Wi-Fi's `stop_marlin [MARLIN_WIFI] wait for lock release`.  The BT close waits
for the CP's thread-delete interrupt (`bt_close_completion`, `CP_TIMEROUT` 30 s)
holding `power_lock`, and Wi-Fi's teardown needs the same lock.  This is also what
FINDINGS 23 measured and blamed on NM, and why `e5-bt-attach` always ended in
"final-sigterm timed out".

Android's dmesg shows the HAL sending `01 A1 FC 03 00 00 00` -- 0xfca1 with `00 00
00`, the counterpart of the `00 00 01` enable from 0018 -- 25 ms before
`mtty_close`, and `cp bt delete thread ok` 17 ms after it.  `kernel/patches/0021`
sends that from `mtty_close()` itself, before `stop_marlin()`.  First tried from the
HCI driver's `hdev->shutdown` at adapter power-off (with a non-persistent setup to
re-configure at power-on): that left the controller dead -- with the tty still open
the CP no longer answered the next pskey (`0xfca0 tx timeout`).  The disable belongs
right before the tty goes, as the HAL has it.  Also `e5-bt-attach` is now
`Before=bluetooth.service`, so bluetoothd has powered the adapter off before
btattach is killed.  Result: `cp bt delete thread ok` at once, NM stopped in under a
second, the whole shutdown 2.7 s, and the USB link gone 8 s after `systemctl
reboot` (35 s before); BT power-off/on from bluetoothctl still works.  0021 is in a
module (`sprdbt_tty`, initramfs), so the kernel stays `#4`.

## 36. Native baseband, step 1: the SIPC AT channel as a WWAN port (2026-09-26)

Goal: the stock Linux modem stack (kernel WWAN framework, ModemManager,
NetworkManager, Phosh, Calls, Chatty) on the baseband, instead of unisoc-cpd's private
socket.  The CP boot stays Android's `modem_control` in its chroot for now
(`sprd_modem_loader` accepts no other caller, and it needs the Trusty TA).

**The port.**  `stty_nr` (SIPC dst 5, channel 6, 32 rings) are spipe character
devices, not ttys, so ModemManager cannot take them.  `kernel/patches/0022`
(`sipc_wwan`, `CONFIG_WWAN=m`) registers one WWAN AT port, `/dev/wwan0at0`, on the
`stty_nr` platform device, modelled on `rpmsg_wwan_ctrl`: writes to ring 1 (the
command ring), reads from ring 1 with ring 0's URCs merged in by whole lines between
reply lines (the SMS `> ` prompt has no newline, so ring 1 passes straight through).
Checked by hand: `+CPIN: READY`, `+CEREG: 2,1`, `+CGMI` Spreadtrum, URCs (`+CSQ`,
`+CESQ`, `+CGREG`) arriving merged, `AT<CR><LF>` (ModemManager's terminator) fine.

**Three ways to lose the CP's AT server** found on the way -- each silent (AT dead
for every client, unisoc-cpd included, no assert) or an assert, each costing a reboot:

* **Writing to ring 0.**  The first version exposed rings 1 and 0 as two AT ports;
  ModemManager probed both with `AT`, and nothing on either answered from then on.
  Ring 0 is receive-only; nobody ever writes it (unisoc-cpd only reads it).
* **Leaving the rings unread.**  Three seconds into a handover (unisoc-cpd stopped,
  port not yet open), after an earlier ModemManager session had changed the modem's
  report settings: `MN_AL Task PS ... Error 0xb, The queue was full`.  A 2 KiB ring
  fills in seconds when reports flow, and the CP's queue backs up behind it.  The
  driver now drains both rings from load and drops what arrives while the port is
  closed (285 bytes over one ModemManager session) -- which makes it and a user of
  `/dev/stty_nr0/1` mutually exclusive.  The CP recovered from this assert by itself
  (dump wait, then the bearer came back).
* **`ATZ`.**  ModemManager's enable sequence starts with it; no reply, and AT was
  dead from then on.

**ModemManager 1.24, generic plugin**, ports tagged by a runtime udev rule
(`ID_MM_DEVICE_PROCESS`, `ID_MM_PORT_TYPE_AT_PRIMARY` on `wwan0at0`, the same
`ID_MM_PHYSDEV_UID` on it and `sipa_eth0`): the modem is created -- Spreadtrum,
firmware `5G_MODEM_V2_23B_W24.16.1`, IMEI, own number, SIM (IMSI, ICCID, operator
46015), modes 4G/5G, ports `wwan0at0` (at) + `sipa_eth0` (net) -- after about sixty
probe/init commands, none of them harmful.  Enabling fails on `ATZ`.  Next: a
`unisoc` ModemManager plugin (no `ATZ`, the vendor power-up, the M-ETHER bearer with
the static IP config of `+CGCONTRDP`), carried in Debian's source package like the
NetworkManager fixes.

## 37. Native baseband, step 2: ModemManager and NetworkManager own the modem (2026-09-26)

The CP still boots under Android's `modem_control` in its chroot; everything after
that is the stock Linux stack.  At boot `e5-sipc-wwan` loads `sipc_wwan`,
ModemManager's `unisoc` plugin drives `wwan0at0` and `sipa_eth0`, and
NetworkManager's `Mobile` connection brings the data up.  Phosh shows the signal,
Calls and Chatty see the modem, and `unisoc-cpd` with `e5-bearer-up`/`-watch` is
retired (installed, not enabled; starting `unisoc-cpd` stops `e5-sipc-wwan` and
ModemManager through `Conflicts=`/`BindsTo=`).  Verified on a cold boot: 5G SA,
home, signal from `+CESQ`, context 1 on `sipa_eth0`, IPv4 and IPv6 (ping, HTTP),
the IPv6 /64 on `br0` for the LAN, and the SIM's SMS listed.

### 37.1 ModemManager, patched (`rootfs/deb-patches/modemmanager-0[1-5]`)

Debian's 1.24.0 rebuilt by `rootfs/build-patched-debs.sh modemmanager`, held:

* **01, the `unisoc` plugin**, on the ports `77-mm-unisoc-sipc.rules` tags
  `ID_MM_UNISOC_SIPC`.  The generic modem, except:
  * no `ATZ`, and no `+CPMS=` at all -- a new killer: `AT+CPMS="SM","SM","SM"`,
    which only selected the storages already in use, left the AT server silent until
    a reboot, no assert.  The core gains `MMBroadbandModemClass.sms_storages_fixed`:
    storage locks succeed without a command for the storages `+CPMS?` reported and
    are refused for any other, so listing, reading, storing and deleting stay on SM.
  * capabilities (GSM/UMTS, LTE, 5G NR) and IP families (IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6) are
    stated: `+GCAP` says `+CGSM` only, `+WS46=?` is unsupported, and `+CGDCONT=?`
    lists `"IP"` only although the contexts are IPV4V6.  Without this ModemManager
    ran CS/PS registration checks only and never saw the NR SA registration.
  * signal from all nine `+CESQ` fields (the generic parser stops at LTE; `+CSQ`
    answers `255,99` on NR), also from the `+CESQ` the modem sends unsolicited every
    few seconds.  Its unsolicited `+CSQ`, `+SIND`, `+SPSLICEQUE`, `^CONN`/`^CEND` ...
    are swallowed -- they had ended up inside replies (the model read
    `+SPSLICEQUE:2|1,1|1 ^CONN: 11,2,2 V1.0.1-B7`).
  * power, measured: `+CFUN=4` and `+CFUN=1` are flight mode and back with the SIM
    kept on.  **`+CFUN=0` switches the SIM off and nothing brings it back within
    that boot**: afterwards `AT+SFUN=2` answered "operation not allowed" or nothing,
    `+CPIN` stayed "SIM not inserted", and a second `CFUN=0` timed out.  So power
    down/off is `+CFUN=4`, never 0.  The CP modem_control boots is at `+CFUN: 0`
    with the SIM off, though; from there the vendor RIL's `AT+SFUN=2` (SIM on) and
    `AT+SFUN=4` (stack on) work, and the plugin sends them as soon as the port is
    open, before initialization reads the SIM.
  * the bearer: `+CGACT=1,<cid>`, `+CGDATA="M-ETHER",<cid>` (CONNECT, the port stays
    in command mode), then `+CGCONTRDP=<cid>`: IPv4 static (no gateway -- the
    default route goes out of the interface), IPv6 by RA with the DNS servers of the
    dotted IPv6 line and **the network's interface identifier as the link-local
    address**: `sipa_eth0` is `link/none`, so NetworkManager has no MAC to derive
    one from, and without an address from the bearer IPv6 never came up.
    Disconnect is `+CGACT=0,<cid>`.
* **02**: the solicited `+CREG`/`+CGREG`/`+CEREG` patterns took a one-digit AcT and
  are anchored at the end, so `+CGREG: 2,1,"0000","00246005",11` (NR on a 5G core)
  was "Unknown registration status response" -- on any 5G modem.
* **03**: `+CMGL` in PDU mode puts an empty line between each header and its PDU
  here, which failed the whole listing.
* **04**: `at_command_via_dbus` on, so `mmcli --command` works without `--debug`:
  `/opt/e5/e5-at` (and UFI-TOOLS through it) asks ModemManager now, and refuses
  `ATZ`, `AT&F`, `AT+CPMS=`, `AT+CFUN=0`, `AT+SFUN=3/5`.
* **05**: new contexts may take the ids below the first defined one.  **The CP
  routes context N to the SIPA net id N-1, and only context 1 reaches `sipa_eth0`**.
  The CP boots with only the IMS context at 11 (unisoc-cpd defined 1 itself), so
  ModemManager put the APN at 12: connected, addressed, and not one packet back on
  `sipa_eth0` (none on `sipa_eth11` either, by hand).  The bearer now uses
  `sipa_eth<cid-1>` and says so if ModemManager does not have it.

`mm-modem-helpers` tests (32 programs) pass with 02, 03, 05 and a test for 05.

### 37.2 Getting the ports to ModemManager in one piece

* `sipc_wwan` loads long before the CP has booted, and a port that refuses to open is
  probed once and forgotten.  `kernel/patches/0023`: the port is registered when the
  sbuf channel comes up and removed when it goes down (a CP reset), watched once a
  second besides `SBUF_NOTIFY_READY`.  A module reload -- the same thing as a CP reset
  to ModemManager -- came back as a new modem and NetworkManager reconnected by itself.
* ModemManager sees `sipa_eth0` from early boot.  Alone, it fails probing (a virtual
  netdev has no driver for the plugin filters), and the device's probe list is reset,
  so the AT port arriving later made a modem with no data port.
  `78-e5-mm-sipc.rules` hands `sipa_eth0` over only while an AT port exists, and
  re-announces it when one appears.
* Checksum offload on `sipa_eth*` is off by `etc/systemd/network/10-e5-sipa-eth.link`
  (unisoc-cpd did it with ethtool after each bearer).
* NetworkManager manages `wwan0at0` (the modem device; `sipa_eth0` stays unmanaged
  as its IP interface), `Mobile.nmconnection` in `/usr/lib/NetworkManager`, APN
  `cbnet`, retries forever.  The dispatcher runs `e5-ipv6-share` with
  `E5_V6_NM=1`, which leaves the uplink's IPv6 to NetworkManager and only moves the
  /64 to `br0`.

### 37.3 Two boot faults this exposed

* **An ordering cycle dropped `e5-vendor` on every boot**: `e5-cp_diskserver` was
  `Before=e5-vendor` (which is `Before=sysinit.target`) but, with the default
  dependencies, after `sysinit.target`.  systemd deleted the `e5-vendor` start job;
  the CP only came up because `unisoc-cpd`'s `Wants=` queued the vendor again later.
  cp_diskserver is `After=` it now (`android-run` waits for the chroot anyway).
* **`/dev/null`, `zero`, `full`, `random`, `urandom`, `tty` arrive mode 0660** from
  early boot on some boots (the kernel creates them 0666; the culprit is not found
  yet).  dbus-daemon, which drops to `messagebus`, then died with "Failed to open
  /dev/null: Permission denied" and NetworkManager, bound to it, never started.
  `rootfs-fixups` (before sysinit) logs and restores 0666.

### 37.4 Sending SMS and calls

* **MO SMS: the service centre has to be written once per boot.**  Until then
  every `+CMGS` answered `+CMS ERROR: 313` ("SIM failure") -- from ModemManager,
  and from unisoc-cpd's exact sequence replayed on the port with ModemManager
  stopped; with the SMSC in the PDU or not, national or international
  destination, GSM7 or UCS2, `CSCS` GSM or UCS2, `+CGSMS` 2 or 3, voice- or
  data-centric (`+CEUS`).  `AT+CSCA="<smsc>",145` with the very value `+CSCA?`
  reported (what unisoc-cpd's "re-arm the SMS surface" did, FINDINGS 25.7 of
  its tree) and the next submit went through, and every submit after it,
  ModemManager's included.  The plugin writes the SMSC back (verbatim, in
  whatever charset it read it) right after setting up the SMS format;
  verified from a fresh boot, delivered.
* Also measured on the way: `+CIREG` reports registration (`1`) with no
  capability bits at all, before and after `+CEUS=1` -- this CP does not fill
  them in, so they say nothing about IMS SMS or voice.
* **MO VoLTE call through ModemManager**: `ATD<n>;` answers `+CDU: 1` before
  its `OK`, which ModemManager took for a failed dial ("Unhandled response
  '+CDU:1'") while the CP placed the call anyway.  With `+CDU:` swallowed:
  dialing, ringing-out (followed by ModemManager's `+CLCC` polling, every 2 s),
  hang-up.  The call reports `^DSCI:`, `+SPCALLEXTINFO:`, `+CLCCS:`, `+ECIND:`,
  `+SIND:` along the way, all swallowed.  There is no audio yet: nothing routes
  the codec into the CP's voice path (unisoc-cpd never had it either:
  `voice.supported = false`, the far end heard silence).
* `sipc_wwan` (kernel `0024`) drops the `<LF>` ModemManager puts after every
  command on a non-tty port: the vendor RIL ends commands with `<CR>` only,
  and after `AT+CMGS=<n><CR>` the `<LF>` would be the PDU's first byte.  (It
  was not what the 313 was.)

### 37.5 UFI-TOOLS piled up hundreds of nmcli

The web page polls its status once a second, and every status ran two or three
`nmcli` (the hotspot, and since the mobile-data toggle moved to NetworkManager,
one more).  When NetworkManager was slow to answer, `run_shell`'s timeout killed
the `sh` wrapper but not the `nmcli` under it: load average 635, 1.2 of 1.4 GiB
used, telnet and the web page unresponsive, the shell only reachable over the
USB serial console.  `run_shell` now kills the whole process group on timeout,
and `SystemControl` reuses a read-only `nmcli` answer for 3 s with one query in
flight at a time (20 concurrent status calls: 2 `nmcli` runs).

### 37.6 Behaviour to know

* **Chatty deletes the SMS it imports** from the SIM (standard Chatty; they live in
  its history database, `~/.purple/chatty/db/chatty-history.db`).  unisoc-cpd never
  deleted anything.
* The unisoc-cpd web page (`:7887`) is gone with the daemon; UFI-TOOLS keeps working
  through `e5-at`.
* Confirmed in use afterwards: SMS and calls both ways from Chatty and Calls.
  Open: call audio (neither side hears anything), and a real CP reset (the module
  reload stands in for it).

### 37.7 Cell info: band, PCI and the neighbours (2026-09-26)

ModemManager had no cell info for this modem (`mmcli --get-cell-info`:
"operation not supported") and its Signal interface only what `+CESQ` carries,
which has no LTE SINR.  The CP's engineering-mode query has all of it, and is
what UFI's own firmware tools read: `AT+SPENGMD=0,<page>,<item>` answers one
line of `-`-separated fields (a negative number just follows its separator,
`-9963--1209`), levels in hundredths of a dB(m).

    0,14,1  NR serving: 0 band, 1 NR-ARFCN, 2 PCI, 3 RSRP, 4 RSRQ, 7 bandwidth
            (MHz), 8 gNB id, 9 NCI (low 32 bits), 15 SINR
    0,14,2  NR neighbours, a list per field: band, NR-ARFCN, PCI, RSRP, RSRQ, SINR
    0,6,0   LTE serving: 0 band, 1 EARFCN, 2 PCI, 3 RSRP, 4 RSRQ, 7 bandwidth
            code, 10 eNB id, 11 cell id, 29 TAC
    0,0,6   LTE physical layer: 2 SINR
    0,6,6   LTE neighbours, a field per cell: EARFCN, PCI, RSRP, RSRQ, ...

Checked on NR SA (band n41, 504990): field 5 is a constant -1.20 and 15 the
one that moves, so 15 is the SINR; field 9 is the NCI cut to 32 bits, and with
the gNB id (24 bits here) put back above it it equals the 36-bit
`+C5GREG` cell id (`A10246001`, `A10277005`).  The serving cell changes every
few minutes where this handset lies, and a cell being reselected reports its
NCI as 0.  The LTE pages follow UFI's layout and have not been seen on LTE.

The unisoc plugin (`modemmanager-01`) implements the Modem interface's cell
info from pages 14,1 / 14,2 / 6,0 / 6,6 -- PCI and cell ids in hexadecimal, as
ModemManager keeps them, bandwidth in Hz -- and adds page 0,6's LTE SINR to the
Signal interface.  ModemManager's cell info has no band field: the consumers
look it up from the channel (an EARFCN belongs to one band; NR bands overlap,
and the ones used in China win: n78 before n77, n41 before n90).  An NR cell's
TAC is not in its cell info either; the 3GPP location has it.

* Settings' Modem Details (`gnome-control-center-02`) gains a "Serving Cell"
  group -- band, channel, PCI, cell id, TAC, bandwidth, RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, per
  RAT under EN-DC -- and a "Neighbour Cells" group, refreshed every 5 s while
  the dialog is shown.
* UFI-TOOLS (`modem.py`) fills the web UI's per-RAT fields from the cell info
  (`Nr_bands`, `Nr_fcn`, `Nr_pci`, `Nr_cell_id`, `Nr_bands_widths`, `Z5g_rsrp`,
  `nr_rsrq`, `Nr_snr`, and the `Lte_*` counterparts) and its neighbour table.
  It used to copy the NR RSRP into the LTE fields as well, and had no SINR,
  band, channel or PCI at all.

## 38. The phone UI on the E5: hotspot switch, dialogs, the black panel, scale, BT vs Wi-Fi (2026-09-26)

* **The hotspot in Phosh and Settings.**  Both took only `ipv4.method=shared`
  connections for a hotspot, and the E5's `Hotspot` is a port of `br0` with no IPv4
  setting.  Phosh (0.46) showed the switch off and its `stop_hotspot()` refused to
  run; it has no way to turn a hotspot *on* at all (`start_hotspot()` has no caller
  in the UI).  Settings' Wi-Fi panel did not find the connection and offered to
  create a new one -- NetworkManager's own NAT-sharing hotspot, which would fight
  br0/dnsmasq -- and its hotspot dialog adds `ipv4.method=shared` to a connection
  without IPv4 settings, which would have broken the bridge port.
  `rootfs/deb-patches/phosh-01` and `gnome-control-center-01`: an access point (or
  ad-hoc network) is a hotspot whatever its IP setup, a bridge port is found and
  reused, and no IPv4 setting is added to a port.
* **Dialogs could not be closed.**  Phosh sets the window button layout to
  `appmenu:` in phone mode (`docked-manager.c`), so no window has a close button,
  and this device has no Escape: the back key reports KEY_BACK and BackSpace
  (section 12.1), neither of which closes a `GtkDialog`.  Settings' "Modem Details"
  (a `GtkDialog`) could only be left by killing the app.  `phosh-02` keeps
  `appmenu:close` in phone mode.
* **After a lock the panel stayed black.**  phoc: `DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB
  failed: Invalid argument` ... `Failed to commit power mode change to 1`.  The
  vendor display driver counted dumb-buffer creations in a static that never went
  down (10, raised to 64 by kernel `0006`), and wlroots builds a new swapchain
  whenever the output is reconfigured or comes back from blanking -- live scale
  changes with `wlr-randr` used up the rest of the boot's budget, and screen-off/on
  cycles alone would have in time.  Kernel `0025` removes the count (buffers are
  freed with their GEM object; `dma_alloc_wc()` is the real limit).  Verified: 40
  output off/on cycles after boot, the panel on, no allocation failure.
* **Settings turned the hotspot on four times.**  Its Wi-Fi panel connected the
  hotspot dialog's "response" handler every time the dialog was opened, so the
  n-th use activated the connection n times, each activation tearing down the one
  before.  `gnome-control-center-01` connects it once, when the dialog is built.
* **The hotspot is what wlan0 does after boot.**  `Hotspot.nmconnection` has
  `autoconnect-priority=100`: without it a Wi-Fi network joined once from Phosh
  took wlan0 as a station at the next boot (the driver allows one of
  station and AP at a time, `#{ managed, AP } <= 1`).
* **The on-screen keyboard could not be closed.**  Phosh hides it on Escape or a
  swipe, the back key is BackSpace (section 12.1), and the swipe needs a keyboard
  that is not in the way of the text field.  The keypad's Menu key (KEY_MENU,
  keysym `XF86MenuKB`) was free: `phosh-03` binds it as a global accelerator
  that toggles the keyboard, and it opens and closes it in use.
* **BT off took Wi-Fi down, and the hotspot with it.**  "Cannot join the network"
  after boot: the AP was up for a minute, then `sc2355_assert_cmd reason:3`,
  `hif->cp_assert is 1`, and wlan0 answered nothing until a reboot.  The saved
  rfkill state had the chip-level `bluetooth` switch (sprd-mtty; hci0 is the other
  one) blocked, and systemd-rfkill restores it at boot:
  1. The block ran `stop_marlin(MARLIN_BLUETOOTH)` with ttyBT0 open (btattach) and
     no "core disable" sent, so it waited the 30 s CP timeout for the BT
     thread-delete interrupt with the WCN power lock held -- the same stall as the
     shutdown one in section 35 -- and Wi-Fi's `start_marlin` waited behind it.
  2. bluetoothd kept using hci0, whose switch was not blocked.  Its HCI Reset went
     down SDIO to a BT subsystem that was powered off; the transfer never
     finished (`sdiohal_tx_thre holds xmit_lock`), and four seconds later the
     Wi-Fi firmware, which shares the bus, asserted.
  Kernel `0026`: a block sends the core disable first (60 ms, as on a close), and
  ttyBT0 drops writes while BT is powered off -- hci0's commands time out, which
  is what they should do with BT off.  Verified: booted with the switch blocked
  (both orders of btattach and systemd-rfkill came up), blocked it live with the
  tty open, sent HCI traffic while blocked (`dropping 4 bytes`), unblocked and
  powered hci0 again: no assert, the AP up throughout.  The block had been saved
  during the BT bring-up, not by the shell.
  Still open: the vendor configuration (pskey/RF/core enable, kernel `0018`) is
  sent once, when btattach attaches, so after any BT power cycle (rfkill, or the
  shell's BT switch, which blocks both switches) hci0 comes back on the ROM
  defaults with the placeholder address 27:93:31:14:22:11.
* **The hotspot still could not be joined: P2P.**  With `0026` the firmware no
  longer asserted, the AP beaconed (seen from a Mac at -40 dBm) and still nobody
  got in: the Mac's CoreWLAN join failed (`-3938`), a phone the same, and nothing
  reached the host -- no `EVT_NEW_STATION` from the firmware, no event in
  wpa_supplicant's debug log.  An open AP, 2.4 GHz channel 6 and 149 at 20 MHz
  failed the same way, and so did a freshly powered chip.  hostapd on the same
  radio, channel and bridge let the Mac straight in (`AP-STA-CONNECTED`, DHCP
  on br0), also with wpa_supplicant's exact HT40/VHT80 capabilities, and after
  an AP-mode scan (with or without a WPS element in it).  A wpa_supplicant of its
  own, outside NetworkManager, joined the Mac with `p2p_disabled=1` and failed
  without it: the difference is the **P2P Device** wpa_supplicant adds next to
  wlan0 whenever the driver offers P2P (NetworkManager's instance always does).
  While it exists this firmware -- which answers an AP's authentication and
  association itself -- answers no station.  Deleting the device once the AP is
  up does not bring it back.  Kernel `0027`: the driver offers station and AP
  only (no P2P-GO/client/device, and no interface combinations: cfg80211 rejects
  a one-interface combination and allows one interface at a time without any).
  Verified after a clean boot, BT on: the Mac joins `Hotspot` under
  NetworkManager and gets 192.168.9.64 from dnsmasq.  The phone join that
  section 35 records was probably made before the BT attach and NM's P2P device
  were both in place; the `0026` analysis above stands, but it was not the whole
  story.
  Seen on the way, not fixed: the band tables list the HT MCS rates (6.5-130
  Mbps) as legacy bitrates, so every beacon carries an Extended Supported Rates
  element whose values from 65 Mbps up overflow into the basic-rate bit
  (`82 9c d0 ea` read as basic 1, 14, 40, 53 Mbps).  Clients tolerate it (hostapd
  builds the same element), but it is wrong.
* **Scale 0.85** after trying 1, 0.9 and 0.85 in use (the text is scaled to 1.25 in
  Settings; section 21 has the measurements).  `wlr-randr` is in the image to change
  it live; it cannot be applied while the panel is blanked.

## 39. OpenWrt next to Debian (2026-09-27)

`openwrt/` builds OpenWrt 25.12.5 (armsr/armv8, musl) as a second system in the
same root image, the way mu300-linux offers OpenWrt next to Ubuntu; its README has
the layout.  What the E5 needed on the way:

* **Booting a directory of the image.**  `boot/init` `pick_root` reads
  `e5linux/boot-os` (and `boot-os-next`, removed as it is read: one boot) and
  switches to `/openwrt` in the image instead of the image's top level.  Debian's
  overlay is applied only when the root is Debian.  The Wi-Fi/BT firmware and the
  Android vendor subset stay the Debian root's: the initramfs binds them into the
  new root **before** `switch_root`.  A bind in OpenWrt's preinit came too late --
  the WCN driver's firmware request was already pending, fell through to the sysfs
  fallback, and procd has no loader answering it at that point.  The preinit hook
  stays as an idempotent fallback.
* **usb0 must never go down.**  netifd builds its bridge by taking the port down
  and up, and on the NCM function that loses the framing with the host
  ("configfs-gadget gadget: Wrong NTH SIGN" for every frame).  Once it went further:
  memory corruption, a kernel panic, and -- the trial slot not re-armed yet -- the
  device came back in Android (recovered with the `misc` block from adb, section
  24.5).  netifd now owns an empty `br-lan` (`bridge_empty`), and a hotplug script
  enslaves usb0 into it without touching its link state
  (`overlay/etc/hotplug.d/iface/10-e5-usb0`).
* **`CONFIG_BRIDGE_VLAN_FILTERING`.**  netifd sends `IFLA_BR_VLAN_FILTERING` with
  every bridge it creates, and a kernel without the option rejects the whole
  request: no `br-lan` at all.  Added to `kernel/e5-linux.fragment` (`Image` #8);
  Debian is unaffected.
* **procd makes device nodes 0600** where udev makes them 0660 root:root.  The
  vendor daemons drop to uid system with group root, and `modem_control` failed on
  `/dev/chsys` ("Permission denied"): no CP.  The build changes procd's default in
  `hotplug.json` to 0660.
* **fw4 loads its ruleset in one piece**, and this kernel has no conntrack helpers:
  one `ct helper set` rule it cannot take and there was no firewall and no NAT.
  `auto_helper=0`.
* **ModemManager without udev.**  OpenWrt's MM package ships its own rules parser
  and hotplug glue.  The parser takes one action per rule (the unisoc rules are
  one assignment per rule now, in `modemmanager-01` too), and the hotplug scripts
  drop virtual netdevs, which `sipa_eth0` is:
  `openwrt/patches/modemmanager-package-sipa-eth.patch` reports it once an AT port
  exists (as `78-e5-mm-sipc.rules` does on Debian).  `wan` is `proto
  modemmanager` on `unisoc-sipc` (`ID_MM_PHYSDEV_UID`).
* **The proto's IPv4 route.**  The bearer has no gateway (`AT+CGCONTRDP` gives
  none, section 37), and the proto added a default route only via one:
  `modemmanager-package-ipv4-no-gateway.patch` adds a device route instead.
* **The initial EPS bearer.**  OpenWrt's proto sets the initial EPS bearer at every
  connect (to an empty APN unless `init_epsbearer` says otherwise).  The empty
  one went to context 1, so the data APN went to 2 -- `sipa_eth1`, nothing on
  `sipa_eth0` (section 37.1, 05) -- hence `init_epsbearer=default` (the data APN
  as the attach APN, context 1 for both).  But ModemManager stores the initial
  bearer by modifying the profile at its context id, and after a CP boot there is
  only context 11: "Profile '1' not found", and the proto blocks restarts after
  that error -- no WAN until someone intervened.  `modemmanager-06`: a profile set
  by an id that is not defined yet is created with that id (`+CGDCONT=<cid>,...`
  defines as well as changes).  Verified from a fresh install: context 1 created
  as `cbnet`, IPv4 and IPv6 up on the first connect.
* **IPv6 for the LAN.**  odhcpd's relay mode cannot work on this uplink:
  `sipa_eth0` is a raw-IP device (type 65534, NOARP), `PACKET_ADD_MEMBERSHIP`
  fails on it and so does every proxied NDP message.  As on Debian (section 30)
  the /64 moves to the LAN: the proto's dhcpv6 interface already extends the RA
  prefix (`extendprefix`, RFC 7278), `lan` takes it (`ip6assign 64`), odhcpd
  sends the RA (SLAAC, stateless DHCPv6 for DNS).  Verified: a USB host with an
  address from the prefix fetches over HTTPS, and the server sees that address.
* **Wi-Fi**: `wifi config` writes the interface disabled as well as the radio;
  the first-boot script enables both.  hostapd (wpad-basic-mbedtls) brings up
  the AP on 5 GHz ch149/80 MHz, WPA2-PSK, and a phone joins and gets its lease.
  The "Out of memory (-12)" and "Not supported (-95)" lines hostapd's setup logs
  are harmless.
* A test trap: a host whose DNS answers with a VPN's fake IPs (`2001:2::/..`)
  cannot test IPv6 through the E5 with its own resolver -- ask the E5's dnsmasq.

## 40. The vibrator (2026-09-27)

The PMIC has one (`pmic@0:vibrator@2390`, `sprd,ump9620-vibrator`), and Android
loads its driver ("input: sc27xx:vibrator").  Ours was built
(`CONFIG_INPUT_SC27XX_VIBRA=m`) but never staged.  It is in the initramfs list now
(`boot/module-order.extra`, image native16), so both systems have it: a
force-feedback input device (`EV_FF`, `FF_RUMBLE`), which feedbackd drives on
Debian (Phosh's SMS and call feedback) and anything with `EVIOCSFF` on OpenWrt.
**The driver takes the strength from `rumble.weak_magnitude`**: an effect with only
`strong_magnitude` set plays at strength 0 -- accepted, and silent (the first
test here did exactly that).  Verified by hand with a 400-600 ms rumble.

On OpenWrt, `e5-sms-notify` (procd) listens for ModemManager's
`Modem.Messaging.Added` with `dbus-monitor` and vibrates through `e5-vibrate` when
`received` is true -- verified with a real SMS.  Two things on the way: the
listener reads `dbus-monitor` through a FIFO, not a pipeline, because procd stops
a service by its main process and a pipeline's other half outlived every restart
(each one would have added another vibration per message); and the PMIC's
`sc27xx:red/green/blue` LEDs drive nothing on this board -- the E5 has no
notification LED.

## 41. Charge control (2026-09-27)

Unisoc's charger-manager (`drivers/power/supply/charger-manager.c`) takes
`/sys/class/power_supply/battery/charger.0/stop_charge`: `1` stops charging
(`try_charger_enable(cm, false)`), `0` resumes, a second number 255/254 also
turns the power path off/on -- left alone, so USB keeps powering the device --
and a write marks the charger externally controlled, so charger-manager does not
re-enable it on its own.  It is refused while no charger is plugged in.  Its
`soc_control` is the ODM's factory run-in mode ("limit soc 70%", `cm_smt_sm()`):
fixed thresholds, stop at 70 % and resume at 65 %, not a user limit.  So the limit
is a loop on OpenWrt (`e5-charge`).

**`stop_charge` alone does not stop the chip.**  The first check only read the
status string (`Not charging`); the current said otherwise -- +125 mA before,
+121 mA after -- and the AW322xx's registers showed it charging on: control
`0x01=0x30` (CE = 0, enabled), status `0x00=0xd0` (STAT = 01, charge in
progress).  Two flags stand between the write and the chip: `try_charger_enable()`
returns early when `cm->charger_enabled` already equals the request, and the
driver's `aw32257_charger_set_status()` writes CE only `if (!val &&
info->charging)`; neither matched the hardware.  (`CONFIG_CHARGE_PD` is unset,
so the CE path, not a GPIO, is the one built.)  The driver's own
`high_impedance_enable` does reach it: HiZ, the chip stops drawing from USB, and
since this bq24158-like charger has no power path the battery then runs the
device -- -118 mA within 5 s, `0x01=0x32`, STAT 00, still so after 60 s; HiZ off
and it charges again (+25 mA).  So `e5-charge` stops with both (`stop_charge 1`
for charger-manager's bookkeeping, HiZ 1 for the chip), resumes with both off,
re-applies HiZ each pass while stopped (a replug resets the chip) and clears it
when it starts and stops -- HiZ left on would run the battery flat.  Verified:
limit 80 %, at 100 %: -121 mA, the battery discharging towards the resume level.
A kernel fix for the two flags would make `stop_charge` enough on its own.

### 41.1 "Not charging" while charging: the JEITA start (2026-10-01)

The info screen showed 已充满 below 100 % with the current going in and no
limit set.  The status was `Not charging` for whole boots: charger-manager's
`charging_status` held `CM_CHARGE_TEMP_OVERHEAT` ("battery overheat or cold is
still abnormal" every poll) at 31-33 C.  The vendor's JEITA code starts from
status 4 -- the top zone, stop as overheat -- with a reference of 25.0 C
(`jeita_info_init`), and `cm_jeita_temp_goes_up` never lowers the status while
the temperature is above the reference: a battery warmer than 25 C at probe or
plug-in stayed "overheat" until it cooled below the temperature of that start.
charger-manager then disabled the charger in its bookkeeping only (the AW322xx
went on charging, its CE bit following its own flag, above) -- hence the
current in with the status `Not charging`.  Fixed in linux-lts-e5 `c1bb703f0`
(a fresh start takes the zone the temperature is in): `Charging`,
`charging_status 0` at 33 C from the boot on.  The info screen no longer reads
`Not charging` as full either (e5-infoscreen `9b015d5`: full at 100 %, charging
with current in, 未充电 otherwise).

Still open: one boot read the battery temperature at 17.9, 5.2, -7.3, -8.0,
4.2, 16.6 C between 130 and 173 s, 30 C before and after (the fuel gauge's
`temp` and charger-manager alike); the next boot with a sampler from 113 s had
no such dip.

### 41.2 Temperature sources on the running E5 (2026-10-01)

The kernel exposes 25 thermal zones. They are zones, not 25 independently
verified physical sensors: SoC physical/core/cluster/GPU/multimedia/LTE/NR zones,
board/PA/charger NTCs, estimated front/back shell temperatures, the aggregate
SoC zone and battery temperature. At one sample CPU/SoC were about 37 C, GPU
36 C, LTE/NR 36-37 C, board and RF PA 36-37 C, battery 31.7 C. The charger zone
read 84.7 C. `sprd_shell_thm.c` computes the front/back estimates from the
board/PA/charger history; their apparent 43/48 C should not be treated as
measured case temperatures while the charger conversion remains unverified.

The info screen's overview and temperature details now show nine summaries:
CPU (maximum core/cluster zone), GPU, SoC, LTE, NR (maximum of the two NR zones),
multimedia, board, battery and RF PA. A Show more button reveals the remaining
individual zones in the details page. The
API converts thermal sysfs millidegrees and power-supply tenths of a degree to
Celsius, and caches the sample for 5 s. All zone names and readings remain in
Advanced Info, with the charger and dependent shell estimates labelled as
unverified. RAM, eMMC and the SD card expose no separate temperature reading
here; do not relabel the SoC reading as their temperature. These display
changes do not alter charging or thermal protection.

## 42. Touch under OpenWrt: libudev-zero wants ABS_X/ABS_Y (2026-09-27)

On OpenWrt the panel took no touch: the info screen's cage never saw the
touchscreen.  OpenWrt has no udev; libinput's device properties come from
libudev-zero, whose `set_properties_from_evdev()` tags `ID_INPUT_TOUCHSCREEN`
only for a device with **both `ABS_X` and `ABS_Y`** (plus `BTN_TOUCH`); it never
looks at the multitouch axes or at `INPUT_PROP_DIRECT`.  `tlsc6x` declares only
`ABS_MT_*` (`B: ABS=265800002000000`, `PROP=2`) -- udev's input_id accepts that,
which is why Debian's libinput always had the panel -- so to libudev-zero it was
no touchscreen, and libinput dropped it.  `kernel/patches/0028`: the driver
declares `ABS_X`/`ABS_Y` with the MT ranges (`ABS=...2000003`); the events stay
the multitouch ones, which libinput reads from a device with slots.  Image
native17 (the module is in the initramfs).  Debian's touch unchanged (checked by
hand).

**Do not reload an input driver under a running compositor.**  `rmmod tlsc6x`
with cage holding the device: a kernel warning in cage's context, the kernel
tainted `B` (bad page), and the reloaded driver's probe failed (`tlsc6x_hw_init`,
error -1) -- no touch device until a reboot.  A driver in the initramfs is
tested with a new boot image.

## 43. OpenWrt without Debian (2026-09-27)

OpenWrt in `/openwrt` of the Debian root image needed Debian for more than
the space: the firmware, the vendor subset and the modem modules came from the
Debian root (bound in, section 39), and so did the info screen's CJK font.
The standalone form is a root image of its own on userdata,
`e5linux/openwrt.ext4` (1 GiB ext4, about 330 MB used), built by
`E5_STANDALONE=1 openwrt/build-rootfs.sh` with those files inside:
`/lib/firmware` from `rootfs/overlay/lib/firmware`, `/opt/e5/android` (chowned
to root: bionic, section 13), `/lib/modules/<release>/modem` from `out_linux`
(the vermagic has to be the boot image's kernel's), Noto Sans CJK in
`/usr/share/fonts/e5-noto` (where the directory form binds it).  `mke2fs -d`
builds the image from the tree, in Docker, without a loop device on the host.

boot/init (image native18):

* the choice moved to userdata: `e5linux/boot-os(-next)` there, read before
  the old place inside the Debian image (still read when userdata has none,
  so a device keeps its choice across the update);
* `openwrt.ext4` is mounted as the root when chosen, or when there is no
  `rootfs.ext4` -- so removing Debian leaves OpenWrt as the system;
* `openwrt.ext4.new`, if present, is swapped in first (the old one kept as
  `.old`): the running image cannot be replaced under itself, so an update
  from inside it is staged and takes effect at the next boot;
* userdata is moved into the new root at `/mnt/e5-data` before
  `switch_root`, for `e5-os` and the installers.  The initramfs busybox has
  no `mountpoint` applet, and `/proc` has moved by then: a flag set when the
  mount succeeded decides;
* `/run/e5linux/init-features` says what this init can do; the installer
  declines to reboot into an image under an init that cannot start it.

`openwrt/install-standalone.sh` installs from Linux on the device (Debian or
either OpenWrt; the configuration of the OpenWrt already there is kept, the
traffic records with it) or from rooted Android over adb, where the first
boot's APN and hotspot go to `e5linux/openwrt-install.conf` on userdata for
`90-e5` to take in.  An older init keeps userdata to itself; the installer
then mounts the partition a second time -- the same f2fs superblock, not a
second instance.

Verified: Debian boots unchanged with native18; installed from Debian with
`--try`, OpenWrt ran from `/dev/loop0` with the modem, WAN, hotspot and the
info screen up on the image's own files, and the one-shot returned to Debian
at the next boot; an update run inside the standalone OpenWrt was staged as
`.new` and swapped in at the following boot.

Later the same day, a flash package for other people's E5s
(`openwrt/make-flash-bundle.sh`, `openwrt/bundle/`).  The image and the boot
image flashed here cannot be handed on: the firmware and the vendor subset are
proprietary, the BT pskey carries this unit's address and the Android property
area its serial number, and the boot image's initramfs embeds the Debian
overlay (MAC files, hotspot profile).  So the package has the generic image
(`E5_DEVICE_FILES=0`: the Debian-signed regulatory.db, the modem modules and
the fonts, nothing of a device), a boot image built without `--overlay`, and
the pull scripts: `flash.sh` collects the recipient's own files from their
Android into `e5linux/device-files.tar` on userdata, and boot/init unpacks it
into the image before `switch_root` whenever the image lacks the WCN firmware
or the archive changed (a sha256 stamp in `/etc/e5`).  `device-install-image.sh`
does the same for updates, and makes the archive from the running system's
files when there is none.  The first boot of an install from Android makes
Linux the default (`92-e5-default-boot`, `E5_DEFAULT_BOOT=linux`).

The APN: nothing in uficode detects it (it reads the IMSI and names the
operator).  `e5-apn-auto` takes ModemManager's SIM `operator-code` (46015 on
this SIM) to the operator's public APN -- cmnet, 3gnet, ctnet, cbnet -- and
leaves it empty for others (the network assigns its default at attach); it
runs at every boot while `network.wan.apn_auto` is 1, so another SIM or the
other slot gets its own.  Checked on the device: a wrong staged APN was
replaced by cbnet and the WAN came back.

The first flash package failed on this device in two ways, both fixed.  (1)
`device-install-image.sh` made the archive from the live tree, and the vendor
chroot has /proc, /sys and /dev mounted inside it: tar walked into them, left
a 123 MB `.part`, and the image went in without the files -- no modem, no
Wi-Fi.  It now reads through a non-recursive bind of the root and refuses to
install an image with no device files.  (2) With the files in the image, Wi-Fi
still failed ("failed to power on WCN"): the WCN driver asks for its firmware
as soon as `wcn_bsp` is loaded in the initramfs's module pass (about 12 s),
from the initramfs, which gets it from the embedded overlay -- and the
package's boot image has none.  The eMMC is only probed about 9 s into the
boot, after the pass has begun, so boot/init now copies lib/firmware out of
userdata's device-files.tar right before `wcn_bsp` (`stage=device-firmware-early`
at 12.7 s), and the hotspot came up.

## 44. The speaker under OpenWrt (2026-09-27)

`e5-audio-dsp` ran on Debian only; under OpenWrt four things were different.

* **No module index.**  OpenWrt's modprobe knows only its own flat directory,
  so the modules go in with insmod from `/lib/modules/<release>/audio`, and
  insmod follows no dependency.  The codec and its power modules link against
  `snd-soc-sprd-card` (`get_sp_audio_debug_flag`), which was last in the list:
  the power module failed, and the "loaded?" test matched by prefix, so
  `..._power_dev` counted as `..._power` and the codec went in without its
  regulators.  The card now comes right after the PA (its only dependency), the
  test matches the whole name, and the codec waits for both power modules (the
  softdep of `etc/modprobe.d/e5-audio.conf`, for insmod too).
* **No alsaucm** in OpenWrt's alsa-utils: the route is the same UCM file's
  `cset` lines (the verb, Speaker, Mic), applied with amixer -- 48 controls.
* **No Python**, so the DSP profile selects (above amixer's clamp) are written
  by `openwrt/src/e5-ctl-raw.c`, the same ioctl as the Python tool.
* **"The DSP is already running" was a powered domain**: the route's
  `agdsp_access_en` keeps the AGDSP domain up with no firmware in it, so a
  second `start` skipped the image and every open failed ("channel 0 not
  opened, ... dsp_ready 0", -EIO).  Only an image written since boot counts now
  (`/run/e5-audio-dsp.started`).

With that, `aplay -D hw:0,3` plays (heard).  `e5-volume`: 16 levels on
`VBC DAC0 DG Set` (1.5 dB a step, so 3 dB a level), level 15 = 39, the media
gain of the device's own Android, level 0 = 0 (mute); the info screen's volume
keys step it.  `/etc/init.d/e5-audio` brings the card and the DSP up at boot and
restores the level (checked across reboots).

## 45. Bluetooth headphones under OpenWrt (2026-09-27)

The link came up at once (`btattach -B /dev/ttyBT0 -S 3000000`, the kernel's
vendor setup, bluetoothd), scanning worked; a pair of Redmi Buds 6 took five
faults to play, each hiding the next:

1. **A search running during the pairing** kept it from completing on this
   chip: the link came up and a link key was made, the pairing never
   finished.  `e5-bt-connect` stops any search first (the discovery belongs
   to the bluetoothctl that started it).
2. **Not bondable**: the E5 itself sent "No Bonding" in its IO capability
   reply (btmon), so the key was not kept.  bluetoothd sets the adapter
   bondable when pairable: `AlwaysPairable = true` (94-e5-bluetooth).
3. **The headphones' own connection needed an agent**: the moment the pairing
   was done they opened A2DP themselves, an untrusted device's connection is
   authorised by an agent, the pairing's bluetoothctl had gone ("a2dp.c:
   auth_cb() Access denied: org.bluez.Error.Canceled"), and they dropped the
   pairing ("Authentication Failed" from then on).  Trusted before pairing.
4. **The SDP answer was dropped**: the Buds send 679-byte SDP PDUs over a
   channel whose MTU is the default 672, the kernel drops them ("Dropping
   L2CAP data: receive buffer overflow"), the service search never finishes and
   no profile connects ("br-connection-create-socket").  BlueZ has
   `SDP_LARGE_MTU` (1013) for one Sony controller that does the same;
   `rootfs/deb-patches/bluez-01-sdp-large-mtu.patch` uses it for every device
   (a larger MTU offer is always within the specification);
   `openwrt/build-bluez.sh` builds OpenWrt's bluez with it (r902).
5. **No sink**: OpenWrt's PulseAudio init passes `--disallow-module-loading`,
   and a connecting headset's sink is a module loaded then
   (module-bluez5-device).  `/etc/init.d/e5-pulseaudio` runs it without.

Then the speaker went silent through PulseAudio (after a Bluetooth
disconnection, and in fact always): measured with the device's mic playing a
440 Hz tone -- the Goertzel method of 34 -- it came back from aplay and from
PulseAudio with `tsched=0` or `mmap=0`, not from the default (timer-based
scheduling over mmap).  The speaker sink has `tsched=0`: period interrupts,
the kernel's period timer (0013), as aplay uses them; two streams in a row
both measured.

The model string: `+IMSREGADDR:<the IMS addresses>` came in while ModemManager
read AT+CGMM and was stored in front of V1.0.1-B7 (shown as an IPv6 address).
The unisoc plugin ignores `+IMSREGADDR:` and `+SPNRINDICATE:` now
(modemmanager-01); the OpenWrt package carries an E5 revision in its release
(r909) so apk takes a rebuild for a new package.  After ModemManager restarts,
netifd does not bring the WAN up by itself: `ifup wan`.

## 46. A module-load watchdog panicked the first boot of an update (2026-09-27)

The first boot after an update (flash.py --update) came up in Android.  pstore
(`/sys/fs/pstore/dmesg-ramoops-0.enc.z`, read from Android, raw deflate):

    Kernel panic - not syncing: sprd_dmaengine_pcm.ko loads too long time,
    panic timeout = 2000 ms
      panic <- sprd_modules_exit [native_hang_monitor] <- call_timer_fn

`native_hang_monitor` (drivers/unisoc_platform/sysdump) carries, besides
Android's native hang monitor, a module notifier that arms a 2 s timer at
MODULE_STATE_COMING and panics if MODULE_STATE_LIVE does not follow --
MODULES_TIME_OUT, no parameter.  e5-audio-dsp's last insmod, sprd-dmaengine-pcm,
completes the sound card, and the card's whole probe runs inside that init; on
a busy first boot (uci-defaults, the image just swapped in) it passed 2 s.
The panic's sysdump boot used a try of slot b, and LK fell back to Android
(section 32).  Earlier boots of the same image were under the limit: a race.
`boot/module-order.skip` leaves the module out of the initramfs (stage-modules.sh
filters the generated order); nothing depends on it.  Recovered from Android with
boot/flash-trial.sh and the rebuilt boot image; the updated image, its settings
and the installed apps were all there.


## 47. Two SIM cards, and a CP that asserts without a band lock (2026-09-28)

Mainline 6.18 trials under OpenWrt, SIM 1 China Broadnet (46015), SIM 2 China Mobile
(46000); the Android side was read with the RIL's AT log (47.8).  Result: the modem
switches between the cards (`e5-sim`, the info screen, ModemManager's SIM slots), data
on `sipa_eth0` for the first card and `sipa_eth8` for the second.

### 47.1 Channels are not cards; `AT+SPACTCARD` is

The vendor RIL opens `stty_nr0`-`5` (and 13, 14), rings 0-2 for the first card and
3-5 for the second, and the guess was that the ring picks the card.  It does not: on
ring 4 `+CIMI`, `+CCID` and `+CGSN` answered for the first card.  A command reaches a
card through **`AT+SPACTCARD=<card>` as a prefix on the same line**
(`AT+SPACTCARD=1;+CIMI`, as UFI-TOOLS' `RootSttyAT.kt` sends every command), and the
card **sticks to the channel** until a power change: a bare `AT+CIMI` right after
answers for the card named last.  urild itself never sends it (not a string in any of
its libraries).  `sipc_wwan card=<n>` (linux-lts-e5 `9ec968c3b`) puts the prefix in
front of every `AT+` command a port sends, except one that names its card already;
with `card=` set on both cards' ports, a channel left on the other card cannot
mislead ModemManager (it did once: the first card's port without the prefix read the
second card's SIM, and e5-apn-auto kept the wrong APN).

The **URCs are per card**: the first card's on ring 0, the second's on ring 3.  Both
rings have to be read.  With the port on ring 4 and nothing reading ring 0, the CP's
AT server stopped answering everybody within a minute or two, with no assert, until
the CP was reset; `sipc_wwan` now drains the other card's URC ring (`cfbb848c9`), and
ring 4 then answered for 5.5 minutes and on.  **Correction:** the first hang of the
day was put down to a bare `AT+SPACTCARD?`; it was this undrained ring.

### 47.2 The band lock is per card, and a card without one asserts the CP

    Modem Assert: DRM_SPR_RF Task  PHY CP assert in file drm_rfresourcehandle.c
    line 3925 exp=0 info=[Drm allocate spr rf path fail! res_type=16,
    <rat,band,rx,tx>:0x68a0201 0x6290400 0x0 0x0 0x0, is_nr_ant_reduce:0,0 ]

came 10-25 s after the second card's data connection came up, every time -- on Linux
and, it turned out, **on Android too**: with the new card as Android's data card the CP
reset every 15-30 s (the 12:20 capture already had two).  The observed requirement for this
device: the baseband (likely its hardware) needs a band lock on every card -- China
Broadnet and China Mobile on n28 or n41, or they may not register at all; the validated configuration
uses b1+b41 and n41+n78.  `AT+SPLBAND` is per card:

    AT+SPACTCARD=1;+SPLBAND=0    +SPLBAND: 0,256,0,1,0      LTE b1 b41
    AT+SPACTCARD=1;+SPLBAND=3    +SPLBAND: 0,0,0            NR: none -> the asserts
    AT+SPACTCARD=1;+SPLBAND=2,0,0,272,0                     NR n41 n78

The first card had its lock, the freshly inserted second one had LTE but no NR lock.
With both locked: two minutes of data on the second card, both cards on NR SA, no
assert (Android), and none on Linux since.  A lock programmed with the configuration tool survived
the reboot; one sent by hand over `/dev/stty_nr6` on Android was gone at the next CP
reset.  `e5-sim` warns about a card with no NR lock and never writes one.  Note: the
info screen's "默认频段" (NR unlocked) is exactly what this device must not do.

### 47.3 Bringing both stacks up: three asserts, and the order that has none

    T_P_ATC PS CP assert in file mnphone_api.c line 7048
    T_P_ATC PS CP assert in file mnphone_api.c line 7038
    T_P_ATC PS CP assert in file mnphone_api.c line 7401

* **7048**: one card's protocol stack brought up (`+SFUN=4` from `+CFUN: 0`) while the
  other card is attached.  Every time, and in Android's command order too.
* **7038**: both stacks brought up from a fresh CP without the cards' work modes
  (`+SPTESTMODEM`).
* **7401**: a stack (or SIM power) brought up for a slot with **no card in it**.  Measured
  on 2026-10-04 with one card in slot 1: the power-up's `+SPACTCARD=1;+SFUN=2` to the
  empty slot was followed ~5 s later by that assert, the CP's AT server went deaf
  (`[modem0] port wwan0at0 timed out 2..10 consecutive times` → `marking modem as
  invalid` → `mmcli -L` = *No modems were found* → the info screen's 「无模组」), and the
  card that was in the phone stayed unreadable until `modem_control` reset the CP.  It
  is not a one-off: ModemManager replays the same power-up from its cached events at
  every start, so it re-asserted every time (t=40 s and again at t=439 s in one boot).
* No assert: from a fresh CP (both at `+CFUN: 0`), as the RIL does after a restart --
  both SIMs on (`AT+SPACTCARD=<n>;+SFUN=2`), each card's work mode
  (`+SPTESTMODEM=<mode 1>,<mode 2>`, the modes `+SPTESTMODE?` holds), the data card
  (`+SPSWDATA` on that card), then both stacks, the first card's first -- **of the slots
  holding a card only** (patch 07 reads `+SPACTCARD=n;+CCID?` per slot first).  Both
  register; the stacks then stay up, and moving the port to the other card never brings
  a stack up from off.

`AT+SPSWDATA` makes the card it is sent for the one that carries data (`+SPSWDATA?`
reads it; the CP starts on the first card).  Android sends it on the target card's
channel for `setPreferredDataModem`, then `CGACT=0`, `CGDCONT`, `CGPCO`, `CGEQREQ`,
`CGDATA="M-ETHER",1` -- no `CGACT=1`; the plugin's `CGACT=1` then `CGDATA` works as well.
Not on this CP: `AT+SPSWITCHDATACARD` (the old RIL source's primary-card switch) is
`+CME ERROR: 4` in every state, and `+SPTESTMODE=<m1>,<m2>,1` answers OK and changes
nothing.  (`persist.vendor.radio.primarysim` is 1 on Android while its data card is the
second one; no AT for it was seen.)

### 47.4 The second card's data interface is `sipa_eth8`

The RIL's log names it (`Net interface addr linker = sipa_eth8`, `socket_id= 1`): SIPA
net id 8 for the second card's context 1, as net id 0 (`sipa_eth0`) is the first
card's.  No AT names it -- the old source's `AT+SPAPNETID` is not in this RIL.  On
Linux: bearer up, `sipa_eth8` with the `+CGCONTRDP` address, IPv4/IPv6 ping, DNS and
HTTP through it.  (An earlier try that saw nothing on any of the 16 interfaces was the
47.2 assert tearing the bearer down seconds after it came up.)  Also: `sipa_eth`'s
debugfs `stats` prints `tx_errors` in the `rx_errors` field.

### 47.5 The switch

* `sipc_wwan card=` from `/etc/config/e5-sim` (`e5-sipc-wwan`; the 5.15 build has no
  `card` parameter and loads without it for the first card);
* the unisoc plugin (patch 01, amended by 07, OpenWrt release E5REV 6): the 47.3 bring-up from
  `+CFUN: 0`, `+SPSWDATA` before every dial, context 1 on the modem's own net port (not
  `sipa_eth0` by name), and **SIM slots**: both cards listed (the other one's ICCID and
  IMSI read with its prefix), `SetPrimarySimSlot` runs `e5-sim` (detached: it restarts
  ModemManager).  LuCI's ModemManager page shows both then;
* `26-e5-sipa-eth` hands the card's interface to ModemManager and withdraws the other
  card's from its event cache (both are tagged as the modem's net port);
* `e5-sim <0|1>`: `ifdown wan`, stop ModemManager, the port for the other card, start
  ModemManager, the card's APN (`e5-apn-auto`), `ifup wan` -- about 45 s, no CP reset;
  `e5-sim` alone lists both cards and their band locks.

Seen on the device: SIM 1 -> 2 from the info screen, 2 -> 1 with `e5-sim 0`, 1 -> 2 with
`mmcli --set-primary-sim-slot=2`, and a fresh CP straight onto the second card; data
each time, no assert.  The second card has no own number: `AT+CNUM` is `Not found` on
it (the SIM holds no MSISDN), so ModemManager shows none.  Its ICCID has an `F` in it
(`898600642825F7137081`), as on Android.

### 47.6 CP resets in seconds: `e5-modemd`

`modem_control` waits for the CP log daemon's `SLOGMODEM DUMP COMPLETE` before it resets
an asserted CP -- 300 s without one (section 30).  `openwrt/src/e5-modemd.c` is that
client on the abstract socket `@modemd`: it answers every `Modem Assert` (and `Modem
State: Assert` for a client that connects during one) and `Modem Blocked`, which
`modem_control` resets after the same dump ("block, later reset").  Reset to `Modem
Alive` in 4-5 s, a dozen times today.  `e5-modemd blocked` sends `Modem Blocked` itself:
a CP reset on demand, for an AT server that hangs without an assert.  (It first
answered only `Assert`, and a `blocked` then sat unanswered.)

### 47.7 Traps on the way

* ModemManager without udev reads only rule files named `77-mm-*` to `80-mm-*`
  (`mm-kernel-device-generic-rules.c`): OpenWrt's `78-e5-mm-sipc.rules` had never been
  read -- neither its tty ignore nor, later, the `sipa_eth8` tags.  Now
  `78-mm-e5-sipc.rules`.
* The trial root was older than the repository: its `e5-sipc-wwan` still insmodded
  `wwan.ko`, which does not exist on mainline (built in), exited 1 and never loaded
  `sipc_wwan` -- the "did not load it by itself" of the M4 re-check.
* The info screen's WebKit keeps its HTTP cache in `/tmp/run/e5-infoscreen/.cache`,
  which outlives the session; uhttpd sends no `Cache-Control`, so a restarted page ran
  the old `app.js` until the next boot.  The session clears `WebKitCache` at start.
* The first `CFUN=0` then `CFUN=1` of the day brought a hot-inserted SIM back (`+CPIN:
  READY`), unlike section 37's note that nothing does within a boot.  Only seen once.
* SIM hot plug is not handled: the plugin drops the CP's `+ECIND: 3,<v>` (the RIL's
  hot-plug report) with its other unused URCs, so a card inserted while running is not
  seen until the CP reads it again.  Not finished: the CP's report on a real plug was
  not captured.

### 47.8 Reading the Android RIL's AT log

The AT lines (`RIL-AT`) are logged only when urild starts on a `userdebug` build:

    logcat -G 16M -b radio
    resetprop ro.build.type userdebug
    logcat -b radio -v time > /data/local/tmp/radio.log &    (before the restart)
    setprop ctl.restart vendor.ril-daemon
    sleep 5; resetprop ro.build.type user

The default 256 KiB radio buffer loses the init sequence within a minute.  `pkill -f`
with a pattern that is on the running shell's own command line kills that shell (and
the `resetprop` after it).  For AT on Android next to urild: `/dev/stty_nr6` is free
(urild holds 0-5, 13 and 14; other daemons 21, 28, 31).

## 48. Userdata's F2FS damaged under mainline, three times; the power off (2026-09-29)

### 48.1 What was found

Three times the userdata F2FS (`mmcblk0p70`, plain F2FS, Android 13's) came back from
a reset or power cycle under the mainline kernel with metadata blocks that hold an
**older version of some metadata** -- never under the vendor 5.15 kernel (Android).
Evidence under `logs/noboot-20260929/` (`meta*.bin` are the first 154 MiB: SB, CP,
SIT, NAT, SSA; `third/` the third one).

1. **First** (found 2026-09-29 morning; Android stayed on its logo, Linux fell to the
   rescue): NAT block 0's current copy (`0xa00`, the root inode nid 3 in it) held a
   SIT block, NAT block 5 too.  The root inode unreachable: the whole `/data` gone.
   Userdata was formatted in TWRP.
2. **Second** (the same day; after an OpenWrt reboot that left userdata dirty, the
   root being a loop image in it): NAT block 1's current copy (`0xa01`) held a
   checkpoint block of an older checkpoint (version `...119`, elapsed 1972 s, about a
   minute before the reset), NAT block 4's (`0xa04`) an older SIT block 1.
   `/data/e5linux` (nid 476, NAT block 1) listed by its parent but not found.
3. **Third** (the next boot after a *clean* power off -- remounted read-only, CP
   `0x45` `CP_UMOUNT`, reliable writes already off, section 48.3): the mount failed,
   `Current segment's next free block offset is inconsistent with bitmap, logtype:1,
   segno:2521, type:0, next_blkoff:19, blkofs:19` (-EUCLEAN).  Android's fsck.f2fs
   then found 4423 blocks in use that the SIT has free, all in segments 2510-2521 --
   one SIT block (#45, segments 2475-2529) read back as a version from before those
   segments were written, while the checkpoint written after it was the new one.
   fsck fixed it; Android boots.

What is common: the damaged blocks are F2FS metadata written by mainline in its last
checkpoints before a power cycle, read back afterwards as an *older* content (of
themselves, or of another metadata block); the checkpoint that followed them is
there.  That is what a write cache that loses writes it had acknowledged looks like
-- or an eMMC mapping that went back to stale pages.

### 48.2 What was tested, and is not it

* `blackbox` (`mmcblk0p48`, backed up to `logs/noboot-20260929/blackbox-mmcblk0p48.img.gz`)
  as a raw target: self-tagged 4 KiB blocks, random writes of 1-16 blocks, a quarter
  O_DSYNC (REQ_FUA), fdatasync now and then, reset in the middle -- 4 x `reboot -f`
  and 3 x SysRq-B, 36 000-58 000 writes each: no block ever held another block's
  data (`work/mmctest/tagwrite.c`).  **It could not see the failure of 48.1**: an
  older generation of the same block counted as fine.  The test to do (STATUS):
  everything written and flushed, then the power cycle, then every block must be the
  last generation.
* **The durability test (2026-09-29, `upstream/init-durability` + `upstream/tools/blkgen.c`;
  `logs/durability-20260929/`): flushed data is not lost.**  On `blackbox` (500 MiB,
  127 743 blocks of 4 KiB, backed up first), each cycle wrote a new generation to every
  block in a random order through the page cache, `fdatasync` (the cache flush), marked
  it done, flushed again, then ended the boot; the next boot, under 6.18.54 at
  `1684c0ccb` with userdata never mounted, read every block back.  4 x `poweroff -f`
  (the PMIC power off; the cable in, back up in charger mode), 2 x `poweroff -f -n` with
  4000 blocks written after the last flush, 2 x `reboot -f`, 2 x SysRq-B: every block
  held the generation flushed last, every time (the 4000 unflushed ones had landed as
  well); no torn block, none with another block's data.  So neither the power off
  nor a reset loses what the kernel flushed on this eMMC path, and 48.4's eMMC
  differences are not what corrupts userdata by themselves -- which fits 48.1 better
  anyway: the damaged blocks held *other* metadata blocks' contents (a NAT block
  holding a SIT or a checkpoint block), wrong data at the right place rather than a
  lost write.  Next: the F2FS side (STATUS).
* **The F2FS test (2026-09-29, `upstream/init-f2fstest`; `logs/durability-20260929/
  f2fs-run-log.txt`): no damage in 30 cycles.**  `blackbox` formatted as userdata is
  (static f2fs-tools 1.16: `encrypt verity extra_attr project_quota quota_ino casefold`,
  utf8 -- the same feature word, 0x1499), mounted with boot/init's options
  (`noatime,nodiratime`, mainline's defaults otherwise, discard among them), a 200 MiB
  ext4 image in it on a loop device with `noatime` as OpenWrt's root; each cycle 90 s
  of load (small files with fsync, rename over and deletes in the ext4 image, larger
  files with fsync and a growing log straight in F2FS, directories and `sync`), then a
  `reboot -f` or (every fourth) `poweroff -f` with everything mounted; before each mount
  a dry-run `fsck.f2fs -f`.  30 cycles: every fsck clean, every mount fine, from the
  fourth on every checkpoint `CP_UMOUNT` as in 48.1's third and fourth damage; one
  uncontrolled power loss (a hang of the test's own) came back clean as well.  What the
  test did not have of the real userdata: 22 GiB used and aged rather than a fresh
  500 MiB, Android's own writes in between (encrypted and casefolded directories, the
  5.15 kernel's F2FS -- in all four cases Android had written the filesystem before
  Linux did), runs of 20 minutes and more.
* Earlier (sequential, parallel random, FUA checkpoint stress with verification) and
  one Linux -> Android reboot: clean.
* Reliable writes: the vendor kernel strips `REQ_FUA` from every mmc0 request
  (`sdhci-sprd.c`, `mmc_hsq_status`), so Android never issues one; mainline did for
  every checkpoint.  Off since linux-lts-e5 `155c85bc4` (`MMC_CAP2_NO_REL_WR`): the
  third damage happened with them off -- not the (only) cause.

### 48.3 What changed on the way

* **The power off** (linux-lts-e5 `262b225ba`): mainline had no PMIC power-off; a
  `poweroff` fell to PSCI SYSTEM_OFF, which this firmware takes as a reset ("Reboot
  into normal"): the E5 came back.  `sc27xx-poweroff` now knows the UMP9620
  (`sprd,ump9620-poweroff`, PWR_PD_HW `0x2020`, SLP_CTRL `0x2248` LDO_XTL_EN and
  SLP_LDO_PD_EN cleared first, from the vendor driver).  LK logs it as
  `pwroffcause="write pwroff"`.  With a charger connected the PMIC powers the E5
  up again at once (`bootcause="in charging during shutdown the devices"`,
  `sprdboot.mode=charger`) -- Android shows its charging screen there; boot/init
  boots the system (configured behaviour), so a power off is a real one only without
  the cable.
* **Filesystems read-only before a reset** (linux-lts-e5 `1684c0ccb`,
  `CONFIG_REBOOT_REMOUNT_RO`): OpenWrt cannot unmount its root (a loop image in
  userdata), so userdata was left dirty under every reset.  A reboot notifier now
  syncs and remounts every block filesystem read-only, the last mounted first.
  boot/init logs userdata's last checkpoint before mounting it
  (`stage=data-last-cp ... clean-unmount|dirty`): clean after every reboot and power
  off since.
* The early firmware pass mounts userdata `ro,norecovery` (it only reads
  `device-files.tar`).

### 48.4 Differences to the vendor kernel still in play

The mainline eMMC path is not the vendor's in: HSQ (vendor: its own `swcq` for mmc0,
`supports-swcq` in the DT), the cache (enabled by mainline's `mmc_init_card`; the
vendor's handling unchecked), the shutdown sequence (flush, POWER_OFF_LONG, then the
vmmc regulator and the PMIC), discard (the vendor sets mmc0's discard granularity to
the preferred erase size), and the mount options (Android: `fsync_mode=nobarrier`,
`checkpoint_merge`, `reserve_root`).  The eMMC: manfid `0x37`, 29.1 GiB, HS400ES.

### 48.5 The fifth time (2026-10-01), with no Android in between

Evidence: `logs/linux-fail-20261001/` (`userdata-meta-39424blk.img.gz`, the
first 39424 blocks -- SB, CP, SIT, NAT, SSA -- read in the rescue before Android's
fsck ran; the rescue's dmesg; boot_b's persistent log).

* The boots before it were Linux only.  The E5 ran the SD card system (userdata
  mounted read-write at `/mnt/e5-data` the whole session, as boot/init did then).
  A test boot image had a kernel without the SD slot (`upstream/out-release` was
  still `1684c0ccb`, the card support is `2019815f2`/`af5e09329`): no card, so boot/init
  took the OpenWrt image on userdata -- a loop root in the F2FS, read-write, about
  30 minutes of use.  Before it `stage=data-last-cp ver=24dbb8b flags=0x45
  clean-unmount`; it ended with a `reboot` (the read-only remount of 48.3).
* The next boot: `data-last-cp ver=24dbb98 flags=0x45 clean-unmount`, and every
  mount -- the early `ro,norecovery` one included -- failed with
  `SIT is corrupted node# 8264 vs 4132` / `Failed to initialize F2FS segment
  manager (-117)`: the SIT's valid node blocks summed to exactly **twice** the
  checkpoint's valid node count.
* So Android writing the filesystem in between (48.2's open point) is not needed:
  two Linux sessions in a row, the last one a loop root under load, then a clean
  checkpoint, then a damaged SIT.  The doubled count is a lead for the dump: node
  segments counted twice -- a SIT block holding the entries of another (as 48.1's
  NAT blocks held other metadata), or the SIT journal and a SIT block both carrying
  them.
* Android's fsck repaired it at the next boot (2026-10-01;
  `android-fsck-dmesg.txt`, cut by the kernel's log buffer): at least 3047 blocks
  in use whose SIT bitmap said free, all in segments 993-1034 -- **all inside one
  SIT block** (#18, segments 990-1044, 55 entries a block), and their summaries
  rewritten.  The third time's were in one SIT block as well (#45).  So both times
  one SIT block read back older than the checkpoint written after it.

## 49. The SD card install, and why `--update` cannot update it (2026-09-30)

`flash.py`'s first install -- its default since 2026-09-30 -- puts the root on
an SD card: GPT, one Linux partition only as large as the image, the image
written onto the partition, so the partition *is* the root filesystem and
boot/init mounts it straight.  The marker `/etc/e5/sd-root` is what tells the
card from the eMMC ("removable" cannot be asked of this controller: both mmcblk
devices report 0), so the card may move between units.  The only write outside
the card is `e5linux/boot-os` on userdata, a few bytes naming the boot target
(`sd` for the card, `openwrt` for the image on userdata; the last install wins,
and the card is the fallback when userdata names nothing, so a card whose
userdata cannot be mounted still boots).  `--data` is the form before the card
(the image in `/data/e5linux`).  Measured on the E5: the card installs and
boots -- `findmnt /` = /dev/mmcblk1p1 ext4, mc1 at 208 MHz UHS SDR104, 13.4 GiB
of the card left free.

`--update` was written for the userdata form and cannot update a card install;
it refuses with a message rather than update the wrong system.  The mechanism,
step by step:

* `openwrt/device-install-image.sh` hardcodes its target -- `D=/mnt/e5-data`,
  `IMG=$D/e5linux/openwrt.ext4`.  A card system has no such file: what it has
  is the card's partition, mounted as `/`.
* Called on a card system it sees `/etc/openwrt_release` with
  `image-form=standalone`, takes the `running_image` path, and writes the new
  image as `openwrt.ext4.new` on userdata; `flash.py`'s update then writes
  `boot-os = openwrt`.
* boot/init's `.new` swap exists only for that userdata file, and with
  `boot-os=openwrt` and the image mounted it takes the userdata branch -- the
  card branch wants `boot-os` empty or `sd`, or no other system found.
* So the update would land a *second* system on userdata, leave the card (the
  currently running one) at its old version, and move the boot there.  Settings are
  kept (the installer copies the running configuration into the new image), but
  the target is wrong -- which is why the refusal is in place instead.

Two ways to make an SD install updatable:

* **A.** Stage the new image on userdata (`openwrt.ext4.new` as now, settings
  kept by the installer as now), and let boot/init write it onto the card's
  partition before it mounts anything, then remove the staging file.  Wants
  ~1 GiB free on userdata while it runs, freed after the swap.
* **B.** Write the new rootfs in place over the mounted card root, at file
  level: fewer parts, but it rewrites the filesystem it is running from.

Either needs a `boot.img` and a package built and one device test.

### 49.1 The update as built (2026-10-01): the card's second root partition

Neither A nor B: A puts a gigabyte of writes back on userdata, which is what the
card install is there to avoid (48), and B rewrites the running root.  Instead the
card holds more than one root:

* `device-install-image.sh` on a card system writes the new image into another
  root partition of the card (`e5root*`; the oldest generation, a failed trial or an
  unmarked one first, never the running one), created in the card's free space when
  there is none that fits -- by `/usr/libexec/e5-gpt`, a GPT editor in ucode (OpenWrt
  has no sgdisk; the backup table first, then the primary; checked with `sgdisk -v`).
  The kernel cannot re-read the table of a card whose partition is mounted, so the
  image goes through the whole disk at the partition's offset and is mounted through
  a loop device at that offset; the new partition gets its node at the next boot.
  The superblock is zeroed first, the configuration and the device's files copied in
  as on userdata, and the marker (`/etc/e5/sd-root`) is written last, with
  `/etc/e5/sd-gen` (the running one's + 1) and `/etc/e5/sd-trial`.  70 s for 1 GiB.
* boot/init boots the highest generation among the marked card roots.  A trial is
  set to 0 as it boots and `e5-boot-ok` removes it once the system is up; one found
  still at 0 is passed over, so the previous root boots again with its settings.
* boot/init waits for the card, up to 10 s, when `boot-os` says `sd` or userdata
  names nothing (a damaged userdata names nothing): looking before the userdata
  image instead of after it, it ran before `mmcblk1` appeared.
* A card system mounts userdata read-only (48): read-write only for a system that
  lives there (kept for tests) or to take a one-boot choice off it.

### 49.2 Repeated updates and the multi-system boundary (2026-10-01)

Ordinary updates reuse the other sufficiently large `e5root*` partition;
they do not create a new partition on every update. The current card has
`e5root` (1 GiB) and `e5root2` (1.25 GiB). If neither inactive candidate fits
a larger future image, the updater allocates another with 256 MiB of headroom.

This is one system with rollback roots, not multiple independently maintained
systems. The updater identifies candidates by `e5root*` names and the boot
selector compares generations across all marked roots. A second OS using those
markers could be overwritten or selected accidentally. Rootfs rollback also
does not roll back `boot_b`, which the bundle updates separately. Multiple
systems need explicit system IDs, partition identities and separate A/B pairs;
the design and its shared-kernel constraint are in `openwrt/MULTIBOOT.md`.

## 50. LuCI SMS layout, ttyd's LAN bind and Wi-Fi QR codes (2026-10-01)

The Argon theme gives headings and default form labels widths that do not suit
the SMS page's ad-hoc layout. The inbox refresh button was pushed against the
card edge, the compose labels left large gaps, and the forwarding description
was outside the card. The view now has scoped CSS, a header toolbar, a compact
compose form and a forwarding card containing its description and template
help. No SMS transport or forwarding semantics were changed.

Installing ttyd with its default `interface '@lan'` resolved the logical
network to `br-lan`; libwebsockets selected the first address added to that
bridge, the initramfs compatibility address `192.168.77.1`. Nothing listened on
`192.168.9.1:7681`. `e5-ttyd-bind` changes that logical bind to
`network_get_ipaddr` (netifd's primary address), skips startup if no address is
ready, and an interface hotplug hook rebinds on up/down/address updates. The UCI
setting remains `@lan`, so a changed LAN does not require editing ttyd's address.
The optional package's service gets the adjustment at build/boot and interface
events. Device test: an isolated test LAN changed from `198.18.0.1` to `.2`;
ttyd moved its listener automatically. The real LAN was not changed.

The info screen's Wi-Fi QR generator used `wifi_config().secured`, a field
that only `wifi_status()` had computed. It was therefore always false and
encoded protected hotspots as `WIFI:T:nopass`, omitting the password. The
configuration now supplies the security flag; QR output includes security,
escaped SSID/passphrase and the hidden flag. It uses a four-module quiet zone.
The frontend also invalidates its QR on wireless configuration changes and
on opening the hotspot page; previously only an SSID change refreshed it.
Native ucode checks cover protected/open/hidden networks, missing passwords
and special characters.

### 50.1 A nonempty SMS inbox failed in the ID parser (2026-10-01)

The user sent a test message: ModemManager listed `/SMS/0` as received and
`e5-sms-notify` saw its Added signal, but LuCI could not read the inbox.
`e5-sms list` failed inside `sms_id()` with "Repetition not preceded by valid
expression": its optional path prefix used PCRE's `(?:...)` syntax, which
ucode's POSIX regex implementation rejects at runtime. An empty inbox never
called this function, so the previous empty-list checks missed it. The same
parser is used by delete and forwarding.

The parser now strips the exact ModemManager SMS path prefix and validates the
remaining decimal ID. The command-line and RPC lists both read the real test
message, with its text and sender matching ModemManager. The RPC wrapper keeps
stderr in failures instead of returning only "e5-sms failed"; the frontend no
longer labels every failure as a missing SIM. `openwrt/tests/sms-list.sh` uses a
private fake mmcli to cover a nonempty and empty inbox, object paths including
ID zero, UTF-8 text with quotes/newlines, directions and newest-first sorting.

## 51. Status audit and deferred scope (2026-10-01)

STATUS is a work list, not a second history. Completed SD updates and rollback,
userdata read-only operation, current-card SMS reception/listing, charging-status
display/JEITA startup, temperature summaries, app/settings merge, ttyd's dynamic
LAN bind and Wi-Fi QR encoding are recorded in their sections above. They no
longer need implementation tasks in STATUS; physical tests and unresolved sensor
readings remain separate.

Remote branch heads were checked: e5-linux, e5-infoscreen, infoscreen-plugins and
linux-lts-e5 all matched the corresponding local heads at the start of this
audit. The claim that none had been pushed was stale. The info screen's v1.1.0
release is already public with its tarball and latest.json; the original first
release/upload task is complete. New fixes need a newer version for the device's
version comparison to offer them.

The app store repository exists and its application check/build pass. The first
`store` run failed at `actions/configure-pages`: Pages had not been enabled then.
The later generic Pages deployment succeeded but did not publish the generated
store index. Pages now reports `build_type=workflow`; the failed store job was
rerun successfully: the public index and package both downloaded, with size and
SHA-256 matching the index; the device fetched one app (bigclock). This was
deployment state, not a package-builder failure. The workflow gains a manual
trigger and uses Pages' actual base URL.

### e5-modemd is optional abnormal-state recovery

The binary and procd script are installed, but there is no enabled rc.d link and
no e5-modemd process. The vendor modem_control is running and owns @modemd.
Normal modem startup/data do not require e5-modemd. Its purpose remains specific:
the vendor reset path waits for SLOGMODEM DUMP COMPLETE after an assert/block,
historically 300 s without a client; section 47.6 measured 4-5 s when the helper
answered. No other component in the current tree sends that acknowledgement.
It skips collection of a CP crash dump and does not replace ModemManager.
It remains an optional, currently disabled helper.

### Deferred observations, not claims of fixes

* Deferred Debian/Phosh items: idle blank versus session locking (18),
  /dev/null permissions (37.3),
  desktop portal backend selection, the CP dump client on Debian, and the
  unisoc-cpd 72 h soak remain deferred. The maintained modem stack is MM/netifd.
* The earpiece test was silent and its hardware existence is unknown; further
  validation is deferred. Call signalling works, but call audio is postponed.
  SIM hotplug and simultaneous reception from both cards are not implemented.
* The one 2026-09-25 flash-from-linux reboot straight into Android is still
  unexplained. Later flash.py updates worked; that does not establish the cause
  of the older event. It is historical evidence, not an active release blocker.
* Audio's guarded AGCP-access loss (32), the non-primary AP capture FE stall,
  VBC device-change rejection, headset regulator warnings, DPU blank warnings,
  and bogus advertised hotspot rates are not all resolved. Normal speaker/main
  mic operation is verified; these observations should be investigated if kept
  in scope or reproduced, not relabelled as solved.
* AP+STA concurrency is unavailable; the hotspot currently shares cellular WAN.
  GPU scanout uses vendor KMS dumb buffers and its frequency is pinned at index 3
  (384 MHz). Full pinctrl, frequency scaling, GSP and the USB/debug pin mux are
  enhancements rather than completed milestones. System suspend is blocked by
  the SIPA data path. The SD slot itself is now implemented and used as the root.

## 52. Overview update notification and serialized jobs (2026-10-01)

Info screen 1.3.0 adds a non-modal notice on the overview when a newer release
is available. Release notes expand into a scrollable region, navigable with
touch or the keypad. Update now starts the existing verified installer; Later
saves the offered version and a 24-hour reminder deadline in UCI. Another
release is not hidden by the earlier deadline. Checks run in the background,
normally every six hours with a ten-minute retry after failure, without waking
a blank or key-locked screen. Settings and the overview share one update API.

The API reserves a job slot before spawning the shell worker: reserving only
inside the worker left a gap in which two HTTP requests could both be accepted.
A token hands the reservation to the worker. The worker runs private copies of
the launcher and installer so extraction of a new release cannot alter scripts
still executing. Failed installs retain the existing rollback path.

On-device checks: a second check request was rejected while a delayed fetch ran;
a deferred release stayed deferred on the next request, while a higher release
was offered; a local 1.3.0 package installed from 1.2.0 through the new API,
passed the existing archive/hash checks, restarted the screen and left a backup.
The update notice disappeared after installation. Browser checks covered notes
expansion/keypad scrolling, Later hiding the notice, busy controls and overview
visibility. Battery temperature is now in the overview battery row, with no
duplicate temperature tile; the detailed temperature page retains nine items.

## 53. Mainline flash bundle: fresh SD install verified (2026-10-01)

Bundle `e5-openwrt-flash-25.12.5-mainline-20261001-3dc73ff` contains the rebuilt
6.18.54 release kernel (`00064-gc1bb703f034c`) and a freshly generated OpenWrt
25.12.5 generic image with info screen 1.3.0, the overview update notification,
battery-temperature layout and the SMS ID-parser fix. Package checksums passed;
the image has no per-device firmware/vendor subset and the boot image has no
Debian overlay. ZIP and tar.gz were generated; Windows execution is not tested.

The macOS first-install path was tested from normal rooted Android on slot a:
`--check` passed, then the default SD-card installation completed all eight
steps. GPT was recreated with one `e5root` partition, both previous OpenWrt
roots removed, about 13.4 GiB left unallocated. Firmware/vendor files were
collected from that device's Android and unpacked onto the card. The existing
SSID/key were supplied as initial-install parameters, with no restoration of
the previous configuration archive. A private configuration backup remains in
`work/fresh-flash-20261001/`, outside the distributable package.

After first boot: image `3dc73ff`, info screen 1.3.0, root `/dev/mmcblk1p1`,
userdata read-only, default/next boot Linux, modem connected with IPv4/IPv6
addresses, IPv4 ping successful, hotspot up, Bluetooth powered, sound card and
DSP registered, current-card SMS listing readable, Argon login served and the
app-store index fetched. No kernel panic/oops was found. A subsequent ordinary
reboot returned to the same SD root and Linux default. This does not replace
the remaining physical client, Bluetooth-cycle or thermal checks in STATUS.

## 54. Fresh mainline Debian and SD OpenWrt/Debian pairs (2026-10-01)

The user resumed Debian/Phosh for call-audio research and requested SD
multi-system verification, with Debian **4 GiB x 2**. The kernel repository's
remote `e5-6.18` head matched local `c1bb703f034c`; the E5 port is on v6.18.54.
A new kernel build volume (`e5-debian-kernel-20261001`) and a new Debian tree
volume (`e5-debian-rootfs-20261001`) were used, not incremental object/root
outputs. Kernel release: `6.18.54-e5-00064-gc1bb703f034c`, 78 modules total,
45 in the shared initramfs and 24 audio modules in each Debian root.

### Build corrections

The Debian builder had only staged `out_linux`'s vendor-5.15 audio/modem
modules. It now accepts `E5_MAINLINE=1` and indexes the selected mainline
build's full module archive. The patched-package installer now requires its
binary package set, includes `all` packages (phosh-common and Control Center
data) and the matching libphosh shared library, and fails on installation
errors. An apostrophe inside the single-quoted services chroot command had
broken the configure stage; that quoting was corrected. Standalone home/NM
permissions are applied at build time rather than relying on a Debian overlay
in the boot image. `callaudiod` and `grim` are explicit packages. Packing uses
a clean read-only e2fsck pass after repairs instead of hiding fsck failures.

Fresh Debian 13.7/trixie arm64: 952 installed packages, including Calls,
Chatty, Phosh, patched ModemManager/NetworkManager, PipeWire/WirePlumber and
callaudiod. Image size 4294967296 bytes; roughly 2.6 GiB used and 1.3 GiB
available on-device. The initial 950-package raw image was verified after
writing into both slots, then the two small added packages installed into
each; the final host image includes all 952. Initial raw SHA-256:
`16f0e67d66234e1e4bd80dac6aab37d409ac855ea27f5f70761ca8144da5e55b`.
Final raw SHA-256:
`417a3e926451491a4b1d07461ee2118e52c5dd0589419e84ff310ba93fb52584`.
Artifacts and checksums are in `out/debian-mainline-20261001-c1bb703f/`.
They contain this device's firmware/vendor subset and are private outputs.

### Card identity and shared boot

Backups of boot_b, misc, both GPT copies and the OpenWrt configuration were
saved in `work/debian-mainline-20261001/backups/` and their hashes checked.
The original OpenWrt partition entry was unchanged byte-for-byte when the
new layout was added; GPT header/table CRCs passed. Layout after the test:

| partition | name | size / system |
|---|---|---|
| mmcblk1p1 | e5root | 1025 MiB partition, original OpenWrt A |
| mmcblk1p2 | e5boot | 32 MiB registry |
| mmcblk1p3 | debian-a | 4096 MiB Debian A |
| mmcblk1p4 | debian-b | 4096 MiB Debian B |
| mmcblk1p5 | e5root2 | 1280 MiB OpenWrt B, made by the updater |

Format 1 has the kernel release, default and one-shot selection, and
`systems/<id>/<slot>` PARTUUIDs. A root also identifies itself in
`/etc/e5/sd-system`. Selection chooses the system before comparing its roots'
generations. Registered cards own their choice even when userdata contains
an older boot-os value; userdata is read-only throughout these card boots.
A failed registered selection does not use a writable userdata fallback.
The boot image includes only the firmware/factory-data early overlay, not
the Debian systemd/NM configuration. Its first 56 MiB were flashed and
verified by readback; the boot log area stays outside the write.

### Device verification

* Original OpenWrt booted with the registry and both systems listed.
* `e5-os debian --once` booted Debian A; the following ordinary reboot
  returned to OpenWrt and kept the default unchanged.
* OpenWrt update created partition 5 and registered its B slot. Full hashes
  of Debian's two 4 GiB partitions were identical before/after:
  A `6e71aefdbf6bba6e086dddafefe4e5dd251c1aa779bc2f7675563df3d368df54`,
  B `1f90b2929751ac2bbf0a285337895d7bbbcc843e433d26b241e2bf0cb6d1f3b5`.
  The new OpenWrt booted and removed its trial marker.
* OpenWrt B was then marked as an unsuccessful trial (generation 2,
  sd-trial=0). Debian B had generation 10. The next boot selected OpenWrt A,
  not Debian, establishing that rollback stays in the selected system.
* Persistent `e5-os debian` selected Debian B (generation 10, trial=1).
  It booted its own Phosh session, cleared its trial flag and retained its
  own test state. Marking B as a failed trial (generation 11, trial=0)
  returned to Debian A and A's distinct state. These are marker simulations,
  not deliberately crashed or power-cut boots.
* Test flags/generations were restored: both Debian slots are generation 0,
  no failed-trial flags; OpenWrt B is generation 1 and confirmed. A subsequent
  ordinary reboot again selected Debian A, with a different boot_id.
* Final root `/dev/mmcblk1p3`, persistent SD default Debian, next LK boot
  Linux; userdata read-only. Phosh screenshots from A and B were inspected;
  A displayed the application grid and B the lock screen. SDDM, DSP, vendor CP, WWAN,
  ModemManager and NetworkManager were active, with no failed systemd units.
  ModemManager reported connected 5G NR; Mobile/Hotspot connections were up.
  The sound card registered and DSP replied on the first command; PipeWire
  exposed Speaker and Internal Microphone, with CallAudio present. Battery
  reported Charging. No kernel panic/oops/BUG was found in the checked boots.

Evidence logs and PNGs: `work/debian-mainline-20261001/`, including
`update-isolation.log`, the rollback health/selection logs and final-health.
`rootfs/tests/sd-registry.py` passes for persistent/one-shot selection,
invalid IDs, absent PARTUUIDs, foreign registration, locking and unsupported
registry format. Shell syntax and git whitespace checks pass.

Call audio is still a research task: no real call was placed or answered,
and this run did not perform an acoustic speaker/microphone/earpiece test.
Real call testing requires asking the user for assistance before dialing.
An automated Debian updater, registered-card installer migration, interrupted
registry/GPT recovery and real failed-startup/power-cut tests remain open
(`openwrt/MULTIBOOT.md`). Existing charger/regulator/portal warnings were not
reclassified as fixed just because the desktop booted.

## 55. Phone keys, 0.8 scaling and the E5 voice backend (2026-10-01/02)

The user requested downlink audio first (E5 cannot hear 10099), physical
phone/hangup key bindings in Calls, and scale 0.8. Uplink is explicitly deferred.
All real calls in this session were placed and ended manually by the user;
the assistant used local audio-mode probes and read-only modem queries.

Physical input capture confirmed green KEY_PHONE=169 (sprd-keypad) and red
KEY_POWER=116 (gpio-keys). The existing diagnostic tools misleadingly called
169 NEXT and 523 PHONE; 523 is KEY_NUMERIC_POUND, not the green key.
Calls 48.2-1+e5.1 now captures Phone/PickupPhone in its main and call windows:
the green key opens the dialpad or submits its explicit nonempty number,
and answers an incoming call. No implicit redial is added. Phosh
0.46.0-3+deb13u1+e5.4 uses short power-key release to hang up the active Calls
object via the existing CUI interface; idle locking/waking and long press
retain their existing handling. The new behaviour is gated by
/etc/e5/keypad-call-keys. Both packages built and were installed, including
phosh-common and the matching libphosh. After a device reboot the user
confirmed both physical keys worked. Scale 0.8 was persisted in phoc.ini;
wlroots reports its quantized 0.796875 value. No failed systemd units were found.

Stock callaudiod skipped the E5 card because its ACP-disabled PipeWire nodes
have no speaker/earpiece ports. Calls' SelectMode and EnableSpeaker failed.
Voice codec switches were off; FE_ST_VOICE was never opened. A device-specific
adapter now implements the existing org.mobian_project.CallAudio session-bus
API. It uses the hostless FE_ST_VOICE (hw:0,5, determined by name), prepares
and starts both directions without copying AP samples. A playback application
pointer advance is needed: plain ALSA start returned EPIPE with an empty
buffer; snd_pcm_forward enabled the kernel's hostless start. DSP startup,
hw_params and trigger acknowledged, with both directions RUNNING. Switching
back to default closed the streams and restored mixer/profile state exactly.
Fake-hardware tests cover idempotent start, mute, full restore and cleanup
when the second stream fails to start.

Those facts did not prove downlink audio. The user reported silence with the
initial adapter, and again after a trial which changed the separate voice
DG controls. Both real calls reached active state and the adapter ran during
them; the phone-key/hangup-key test succeeded in the second. The DG trial was
removed in favour of the vendor HAL's actual volume/profile path.

Reference: jingpad-bsp/vendor_sprd_modules_audio, branch W21.24.3, commit
059714f9f094efb6cd0bbfb5e1454b04abc77925; local copy under
work/voice-20261001/hal-reference/. Its whale/audio_control.cpp and
whale/audio_param/dsp_control.c provide the Unisoc VBC procedure. The E5's
own XML route and parameters in work/android-ref remain the board authority.

The subsequent correction uses voice scene 5 and the logical parameter ID
matching Handsfree NB1/WB1/SWB1/FB1 (7/9/11/12), with the same mode offset:
(mode << 24) | (mode << 16) | 5. It applies DSP VBC, Audio Structure and CVS;
this E5 driver's CVS selector is named NXP Profile Select (profile index 2).
The actual vendor voice volume is VBC_VOLUME = volume + 1, set to 9 here.
That control declares UINT_MAX as a signed maximum (-1), so amixer clamped
9 to -1 and failed; the existing raw control writer now handles it alongside
profile selects. Local readback is 0x07070005 for all three NB profiles,
VBC_VOLUME=9, with successful start/stop. Android's codec IIS0 output is DAC0,
so the earlier DAC1 override was also corrected.

The backend consumes audio_pipe_voice channel 2 notifications to follow the
DSP's network bandwidth. Command 0 carries network mask and rate mode;
0/1/2/3 select NB/WB/SWB/FB. An audio-group udev rule grants access to that
one pipe. Unknown/assert messages are logged; no modem reset, automatic
hangup or DSP reset is performed. Speaker is the only supported call output
until the receiver route has been acoustically verified.

Evidence and source/build logs are in work/voice-20261001/. The HAL-aligned
revision awaits a further user-controlled downlink test at this checkpoint;
no claim of audible call audio is made yet. The changes are committed in
separate build, SD, scale, phone-key and audio commits as requested.

### 55.1 HAL-aligned trial still silent; ordinary speaker verified

The user manually called 10099 with scene-5 DSP/AS/CVS profiles and VBC_VOLUME=9
on 2026-10-02 00:12. Both streams started and the user hung up with the working
red key, but the user still heard no call audio. The DSP voice pipe reported
command 0x35/channel 2 with parameters 0x10,0,0,0 at call start and 0,0,0,0 at
end. This firmware opcode differs from the older HAL reference's network
message command 0; its semantics remain to be verified.

The later one-second 880 Hz pw-play test completed, aw87xxx powered its Music
profile, and the user confirmed audible output. Thus ordinary media playback
through the speaker is verified on this Debian installation; cellular downlink
is not. A further active-call DSP/DAPM snapshot is being collected. The old
snapshot monitor only inspected ObjectManager entries, which did not include
standalone Call objects; it now follows Modem.Voice.Calls and reads each Call's
properties directly. No call is initiated by that monitor.

### 55.2 Stock Android audible reference and explicit DSP unmute (2026-10-02)

The user manually called 10099 in stock Android and confirmed audible downlink.
Root adb captured mixer state, DAPM, kernel and audio HAL logcat with
`tools/android-call-reference.sh`; it never places, answers or ends calls and
does not consume the HAL's voice notification pipe. Debugfs was mounted for
reading. Evidence is private under `work/voice-20261001/android/`.

Stock uses FE_ST_VOICE 5 in both directions, mono S16/8000 Hz and DSP scene 5.
It applies Handsfree/NB1 with the same mode/offset 7, VBC_VOLUME=7 and codec
speaker dacs=0/ao=3. The HAL switched from speaker back to receiver, so the late mixer snapshot
shows Handset/NB1; the intermediate HAL log records the Handsfree parameters
explicitly. Android omits the PCM status/hw_params proc
entries; its kernel trigger log supplies the stream evidence instead.

Command 0x35 is logged by the actual stock HAL as "cp voice enable" (16 at
start, 0 at end); it is not the network-bandwidth command. Stock also receives
command 0 with network information. Commands 0x34 in the comparison are
`agdsp_log_point`/`add_audiodsplog` diagnostics, not a missing voice-enable
protocol; their implementations were checked in the unit's own whale HAL.

Android explicitly forces VBC_DL_MUTE during route changes, restores it after
the DSP parameters, and releases DAC1 DSP MDG after the PCMs start. The Debian
adapter now prepares both streams before either start, forces downlink mute,
applies the measured speaker gains/volume, then explicitly sets DAC1 MDG to
0,1024 and VBC_DL_MUTE to disable after startup/parameters. It still restores
the complete prior state on stop or failure and never controls the modem.
Tests cover preparation/start/unmute ordering and restoration on second-stream
prepare/start failure. On-device local startup showed both PCMs RUNNING,
correct unmute readback and exact mixer restoration, without any real call.

The device returned to Debian A with Linux as the next/default boot. The trial
boot-control block was verified by full 32-byte readback SHA-256 before reboot;
no boot image or existing SD root was replaced. User-controlled Debian downlink
verification is pending at this checkpoint; uplink remains deferred.

### 55.3 Debian downlink heard; default speaker remains (2026-10-02)

After revision 8e9b8a4, the user manually called 10099 on Debian and confirmed
"有声音了，但默认开了扬声器". This is the first acoustically verified cellular
downlink on this Debian build. The active-call snapshot and backend journal
are saved under `work/voice-20261001/unmuted/`. The log records the explicit
post-start unmute, both streams running and later network mask 0x10/band 0.

The speaker-only restriction was intentional during fault isolation; it is
now the remaining UI/routing issue. Calls issued EnableSpeaker(False), which
the adapter rejected and left the speaker active. Receiver default and real
speaker/receiver switching are the next change. Uplink remains deferred.

### 55.4 Default receiver and real speaker switching (2026-10-02)

The adapter now starts with SpeakerState=0, uses the stock handset EAR_HPL
route (DAHP OS D=5, EAR_HPL mixer on, HPL EAR Sel=EAR, DAC0 mixer HALF_ADD),
and keeps the speaker/AO path off. Speaker mode disables that receiver path
and enables the previously audible speaker/AO route. Handset NB/WB/SWB/FB
mode IDs are 0/2/4/5; Handsfree IDs are 7/9/11/12. Codec gains follow this
device's volume-7 XML, including the band-specific receiver/AO gains.

The DAC gain control advertises max=2, but its actual two-bit setter accepts
the stock handset gain 3. amixer clamped it to 2. The raw control helper now
writes this value as Android tinyalsa does; readback is 3. No kernel or DSP
firmware was replaced for this change.

EnableSpeaker(False) now succeeds. A live switch mutes the DSP, disables the
old output, changes routes/profiles/gains and explicitly unmutes, retaining
both PCM handles. A failed route write restores the previous live state.
Stopping a call restores every saved control and clears the speaker choice,
so the following call defaults to receiver. An explicit pre-call choice is
recorded without changing idle media routes. SpeakerState follows the chosen
route with the standard libcallaudio values (0 off, 1 on).

Software tests cover default routing, speaker/receiver switching, preserving
mic mute and PCM handles, failed-switch rollback and next-call defaults.
On-device local tests verified both PCMs RUNNING through receiver -> speaker
-> receiver, correct profile/gain/mute readbacks and exact restoration. DAPM
showed EAR_HPL/EAR/RCV powered in receiver mode, Ext Spk in speaker mode.
A separate test through the real session D-Bus API under user e5 verified
properties 0 -> 1 -> 0 and exact mixer restoration after SelectMode(0).
These tests make no modem/call request. Receiver acoustic verification during
a user-controlled call remains pending; the speaker downlink is already heard.

### 55.5 Default receiver downlink confirmed (2026-10-02)

After 2c726fc, the user manually called 10099 again and replied "可以了".
The real-call journal shows receiver profile 0x5, both PCMs running, CP voice
enabled, and successful cleanup after the user ended the call. Together with
the earlier speaker result, downlink is now heard on both output routes and
the default-speaker issue is resolved. This call's journal has no speaker
toggle; in-call switching has the hardware/D-Bus verification in §55.4, not
a separately logged acoustic switch during this call.

The active receiver mixer/DAPM/PCM/kernel snapshots are saved privately under
`work/voice-20261001/receiver-confirmed/`; the confirmation journal is
`receiver-user-confirmed.txt`. Diagnostic watchers and temporary HTTP servers
were stopped, ModemManager logging returned to INFO, and both voice PCMs
were closed. The actual CallAudio service remains available for normal use.
No failed systemd units were reported. Uplink is still explicitly deferred.

### 55.6 Two further calls: successful audio lifecycle, receiver warnings (2026-10-02)

The user made two more calls and reported hearing the other end in a phone
recording. After USB was reconnected, the same Debian boot was still running
(uptime over six hours); no call was initiated by the assistant. Journal windows:

| Call | Dialing | Active | Terminated | Audio cleanup |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| modem0/call2 | 08:08:43 | 08:08:50 | 08:09:07 (reason unknown) | VOICE-STOPPED 08:09:07.505 |
| modem0/call3 | 08:09:34 | 08:09:43 | 08:09:54 (local hangup) | VOICE-STOPPED 08:09:55.029 |

Both audio sessions started the two hostless PCMs and explicitly unmuted.
Both negotiated DSP bandwidth 1 (WB): receiver profile 0x02020005 and speaker
0x09090005 were applied. Speaker/receiver requests completed with no adapter
traceback, failed operation, DSP assert/timeout or kernel panic/oops in the
examined logs. The first call switched receiver -> speaker -> receiver ->
speaker; the second switched receiver -> speaker. The user's recording result
does not by itself establish uplink quality or acoustic verification of each
individual switch. After both calls, no Call objects remained, both PCMs were
closed, and prior mixer/profile state had been restored. PipeWire and
WirePlumber were active; the modem remained connected and registered on 5G NR.

The review did find unresolved errors:

* `ear_switch_event check rcv dvld failed, -110` and the paired DAPM
  `PRE_PMU: EAR Switch event failed` appeared at 08:08:44, 08:08:46 and 08:09:35.
  The codec's receiver startup polls ANA_STS1 for the RCV calibration/loop
  valid bits with a 4 ms timeout. This affected startup and switching back to
  the receiver; the adapter's successful ALSA start does not eliminate this
  hardware warning. Its cause and effect on reliability remain unresolved.
* Four ModemManager warnings could not parse `+CGEV: NW ACT 11,17` / `11,18`.
  Calls still reached active/terminated normally. These are network-context
  activation notifications and a modem-event parser gap, not failed dial
  requests. Subsequent context deactivation notifications were handled.
* Calls logged four layout warnings at 08:11:39–08:11:57: requested height
  593 px versus 553 px available. Layout remains too tall in that view even
  with output scale 0.8.
* Recurring charger-manager read/enable/property errors (-22) continued in
  the wider log window. At review time the charger reported Charging, the
  battery Full and USB online; this does not resolve the driver's errors.
  One SIPA send/overflow event at 08:09:22 occurred between the calls, with
  no subsequent ModemManager disconnect in the checked window.
* The user session's xdg-document-portal was failed because FUSE was missing
  at 02:08:13 boot startup. This predates the two calls and is separate from
  the active PipeWire/WirePlumber services. Root login session dependency
  warnings during evidence collection are not evidence of the user's audio
  session failing.

Private evidence: `work/voice-20261001/recent-two-calls-window.txt`, the
filtered `recent-two-calls-relevant.txt`, full kernel/system logs and final
health checks. The review made no audio, modem or kernel changes. Receiver
startup timeout and CGEV parsing are tracked as follow-up fixes.

### 55.7 Receiver readiness: healthy after startup, early polling times out (2026-10-02)

The requested receiver investigation compared the original Android capture,
the vendor 5.15 source and the mainline port. Stock Android's audible call
also logged `ear_switch_event check rcv dvld failed, -110` twice, with
ANA_STS1=0 and masks 0x400/0x2. It also logged failed initial FDIN polling.
The relevant polling/event code is unchanged by the mainline port; the
failure is not unique to Debian.

`tools/e5-receiver-check.py` was added as a read-only on-device capture tool.
It reads the actual analog register values, decodes receiver enable/clock/
depop/valid bits, saves PCM/DAPM state and follows only the properties of
user-created calls. It never controls calls, changes mixers, opens streams
or consumes the voice notification pipe. Register-offset parsing and missing
dump rejection were checked, then the tool ran successfully on the device.
Register dumps are sequential, not atomic during a route transition.

The user manually called 10099 at 08:26 and confirmed audible output.
Snapshots showed ANA_STS1=0x403 on the receiver, with RCV_DCCAL_DVLD,
RCV_LOOP_DVLD and RCV_DAC_FDIN_DVLD all set, SDAHPL_RCV selected, RCV_EN,
DIG_CLK_RCV_EN and RCV_DPOP_EN set, and both voice PCMs RUNNING. Speaker
selection cleared the receiver route/enable/valid bits; returning to receiver
restored them. Ending the call cleared receiver enable/clock/depop/valid
state and closed both PCMs. Evidence: `receiver-register-check/` and
`receiver-register-call.txt` under private `work/voice-20261001/`.

Two local probes (no modem action) narrowed the startup sequence further:

| Stage | ANA_STS1 | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Routes selected, no PCM | 0x000 | receiver inactive |
| Playback PCM prepared | 0x000 | enable/depop on, status still settling |
| Both PCMs prepared | 0x402 | receiver calibration/loop valid, no FDIN yet |
| Playback PCM started | 0x403 | calibration/loop/data valid |
| Both started, parameters applied, unmuted | 0x403 | all three valid |
| Stopped | 0x000 | receiver inactive |

The complete-start and live-switch probe sampled ten settled receiver states;
all were 0x403. Both probes verified exact mixer-control restoration. The
stage reads add small delays, so they establish ordering, not a measured
minimum hardware calibration time.

The code checks FDIN in SDAHPL_RCV PRE_PMU (subsequence 102), before EAR
Switch (109) enables RCV_EN and before playback PCM trigger. It waits about
100 ms for a data-valid condition that is not ready at that stage. EAR Switch
then enables the receiver and waits only 4 ms for calibration/loop readiness.
Both conditions subsequently become valid, as the snapshots demonstrate.
The concrete issue is premature startup status checking; this evidence does
not show a receiver that remains uncalibrated or fails to power down.

No kernel workaround was deployed or timeout hidden. A driver correction
still needs to place data-valid checking after the data path starts and use
an appropriate bounded calibration wait, then be tested for receiver/speaker
switching and shutdown. Changing a single DAPM event or increasing a timeout
without preserving that sequence would not establish the fix.

A separate new WARN at 08:25:11 came from `sprd_dpu_stop` calling
`cancel_work_sync` during display blanking (phoc), before this call. Its trace
does not involve the receiver capture or codec; it is saved in
`receiver-warning-and-sequence.txt` and remains a display-driver follow-up.

## 56. Installer diagnostics, SD capacity preflight and USB IPv4 (2026-10-02)

The generic "the card does not hold the image..." error hid failures earlier
in SD installation. `flash.py` now checks the remote exit status at each
partition/write/mount/extract/verification stage, retains the actual stderr
and relevant mmc/ext4 kernel messages, and distinguishes a missing adb/su
completion status from an SD content failure. Absolute image symlinks are
verified inside its chroot. Missing/empty/non-executable paths are named.
Gzip CRC and actual uncompressed length, card capacity and write protection
are checked before partitioning. After the existing erase confirmation, vold
releases only this card's volumes; remaining mounts abort before GPT changes.
Seven mocked failure tests pass; no existing SD root was erased for testing.

The Debian multi-system installer checks the complete 32 MiB registry plus
4096 MiB x 2 allocation with read-only `e5-gpt plan` before any card write.
Both GPT copies, overlaps, alignment, available entries and fragmented gaps
are checked using the actual allocator. Failure reports required size, largest
gap and remaining unallocated space; filesystem free space does not count.
`--check` prints the plan without installing. Six synthetic GPT cases passed
with unchanged metadata. Six real stream-writer tests on disposable files
passed: good image, bad CRC, HTTP failure, one-byte/large oversize, and failed
destination write. Prefix/suffix contents were unchanged in every case.

The USB IPv6-only report had a concrete DHCP cause: the USB host's fixed MAC
received an empty option 3 (IPv4 router), while IPv6 RA still advertised the
device. The Mac's actual DHCP ACK showed IP 192.168.9.2 and DNS 192.168.9.1,
but no router. Debian now advertises gateway/DNS 192.168.9.1 for the USB tag.
OpenWrt no longer creates the empty option, and uci-defaults 96 removes only
the legacy `3` list item from kept configurations. Migration tests preserved
custom gateway/DNS options and changed nothing where the legacy item was absent.

Live Debian verification used a temporary netns/veth client with a distinct
MAC/IP (192.168.9.3) and the same usbhost tag. DHCP supplied the correct router
and DNS; IPv4 ping through mobile NAT answered, and IPv4 HTTPS to www.baidu.com
returned HTTP 200. The 1.1.1.1 HTTPS endpoint timed out on this carrier, so it
was not used as the sole connectivity criterion. The temporary client/config
were removed; the Mac's own route/service order was not changed. Existing
computer leases need renewal/reconnection to receive the new gateway.
After the Android comparison reboot, the Mac's real USB DHCP ACK also contained
`router={192.168.9.1}`, confirming the fix for the actual gadget host MAC.

## 57. Debian Bluetooth scanning and headset setup (2026-10-02)

The user reported no scan results and then a pairing-code dialog/failing
headset setup. This was two concrete issues, followed by a gap in the older
SDP workaround. BlueZ, rfkill, btattach, GNOME Bluetooth and both unit-specific
configuration payloads were installed; the controller had the factory address
and manufacturer 0x01ec. Missing RF/pskey firmware was not the cause.

### Vendor transport block restored after HCI attachment

The vendor `bluetooth` rfkill was soft-blocked while hci0 was unblocked and
BlueZ said Powered=yes. A saved platform switch value 1 was restored by
systemd-rfkill after btattach had already configured the controller. The
transport then dropped HCI commands because MARLIN_BLUETOOTH was physically
off. btmon showed LE scan commands timing out and MGMT returning
Authentication Failed (0x05), without a peer authentication exchange.
Releasing the transport block and reattaching restored real scan results.

`e5-bt-attach.service` now waits for systemd-rfkill and runs
`/opt/e5/e5-bt-transport-ready` before attach. The helper releases only the
vendor switch named bluetooth; it leaves hci0's logical switch and BlueZ
preferences alone, and reports a hard block rather than ignoring it.

A real reboot test deliberately put the old platform block value 1 back into
its saved file. Journal ordering was restore at 08:56:10, helper release and
attach at 08:56:11, then bluetoothd. All switches were unblocked, native pskey/
RF/core-enable succeeded with the factory address, and no powered-off HCI
drops or startup command timeouts appeared. Debian A and B have the new unit
and helper. This validates the contradictory saved-state case, not every
radio-off/on or autostart-disabled policy combination.

### Bonding succeeded; SDP setup and reconnect needed fixes

The user-selected Redmi Buds 6 Youth headset was Paired=yes/Bonded=yes even
while GNOME Settings reported setup timeout and then AlreadyExists. It had
stored a key; the failure did not establish a wrong pairing code. GNOME's
standard agent advertises DisplayYesNo and can request local confirmation.
The selected headset was trusted; global pairing confirmation was not disabled.

The kernel dropped its 679-byte SDP response on a default 672-byte receive
MTU. Debian had BlueZ 5.82-1.1, so the existing `bluez-01-sdp-large-mtu.patch`
had never been installed by the Debian image builder. The builder now requires
patched bluez/libbluetooth3 and holds them like its other E5 packages.

Reconnection exposed a second path: src/profile.c opens profile-specific SDP
searches with flags=0. Such a search can cache a 672-byte session before the
device-wide browse requests SDP_LARGE_MTU; merely patching get_sdp_flags() was
insufficient. New patch bluez-02 applies SDP_LARGE_MTU centrally in
create_search_context(), so all new client sessions, including profile queries,
use 1013 bytes before entering the cache. OpenWrt's build script also consumes
this patch list, but its live image was not rebuilt in this session.

Both patches applied and BlueZ built as 5.82-1.1+e5.2. On-device HCI capture
then showed an explicit MTU 1013 offer, the full 679-byte reply and its
continuation received, and ServicesResolved=yes. The headset connected,
remained bonded/trusted, retained its name and appeared as a PipeWire audio
output. No new L2CAP overflow appeared in the final connection window.
The user confirmed their headset test worked before this additional reconnect
fix. Both Debian slots now have bluez/libbluetooth3 +e5.2 on hold; their pairing
stores remain separate. Userdata stayed read-only.

Evidence is private under `work/bluetooth-debian-20261002/` and the similarly
named health/build/boot/runtime logs in `work/`. Native Bluetooth service
start is asynchronous; a connection issued immediately after restarting
bluetoothd returned NotReady until adapter initialization completed. The
successful checks waited for an available powered adapter.

Remaining: the E5 cellular voice adapter routes only to receiver/speaker.
Bluetooth media/HFP registration does not implement the CP-to-SCO call route;
the user explicitly has not tested Bluetooth telephone audio. No call was
initiated here. AVRCP also logged missing uinput; CONFIG_INPUT_UINPUT is not
enabled in this kernel, so remote media-button handling needs separate work.

## 58. Bluetooth headset microphone investigation: still no valid audio (2026-10-02)

This was the initial investigation result. The subsequent controlled PCM
tests in §59 identify two missing operations and obtain nonzero audio; the
normal desktop input and Bluetooth cellular-call route are still unfinished.

The user reported no headset microphone sound and provided spoken test
feedback. The earlier scanning/bonding/SDP/media fixes remain verified; this
investigation did not establish a working microphone or Bluetooth telephone
audio. All PSTN calls continued to be user-operated.

The 09:21 user call's E5 CallAudio log selected the receiver. The service has
no Bluetooth CP/SCO route; S_VOICE_P_BT was off after the call. Thus a connected
Bluetooth headset is not proof that the cellular audio uses it.

PipeWire initially selected A2DP/SBC. It had a smart Bluetooth input proxy
(`bluez_input.<address>`) as the default source; the initial commentary that
the default was the internal mic was inaccurate. A2DP had no underlying
microphone capture node. Selecting HFP/mSBC created an actual input, but an
8-second 16 kHz recording produced 126265 samples, all zero. HCI showed a
successful eSCO connection (60-byte packets, transparent air mode) with no
received SCO payloads. A duplex test added silent playback: 1187 SCO TX
packets, zero RX, and another all-zero recording. This is more than a missing
desktop input selection or a pairing-code problem.

### Bounded controller-mode probes, not a deployed firmware fix

The unit's stock PSKey has g_sys_sco_transmit_mode=0. Its self-describing INI
places this one-byte field at offset 76 in the 176-byte payload. Two volatile
setup probes changed only that byte, retaining the full original blob:

| Value | Observed result |
|---|---|
| 0 (original) | HFP link succeeds; no HCI SCO RX data; capture all zero |
| 1 | SCO RX appears (1835 packets in one monitor); mSBC yields 240-byte all-zero payloads, CVSD 120-byte all-zero payloads; recordings/meter remain zero |
| 2 | No SCO RX; recording remains zero |

The probes do not define the undocumented field's semantics. Value 1 is not
a verified HCI microphone fix merely because packets appeared. A 45-second
numeric-only level meter also remained zero; no voice transcription was made.
The stock blob was restored byte-for-byte and the controller reinitialized.

The unit's own ODM image was read from its checked super metadata and
extracted privately. In odm/lib64/libbt-vendor.so, the SCO_CFG operation
invokes its success callback without sending a further HCI command; the
SET_AUDIO_STATE operation returns -1. This did not support the hypothesis
that the Linux setup had simply omitted an extra vendor SCO initialization
command. No vendor library, radio firmware or modem NV was modified.

### Stock DSP/IIS capture path also not working yet

Android's audio XML selects IIS3 for Bluetooth, and FE_ST_CAPTURE_BTSCO_DSP
for 48 kHz mono recording. On this kernel the FE is hw:0,14, scene 15/ADC2.
Temporary mixer probes enabled its BT backend, IIS3 ADC port selection,
16-bit input width and master controls while keeping the HFP link active.
They returned `arecord: read error: Input/output error` with zero frames.
Waiting for SCO, using the stock 960/1920-frame period/buffer and starting
both hostless BT voice directions with the BTHS/WB profile did not restore
capture. Every probe closed its streams and restored the previous controls.

Pointer debugging showed a valid initial DMA buffer address af725000 and
offset 0 repeatedly, with no forward movement. The earlier hypothesis of an
invalid pointer being mistaken for a buffer offset was not established.
The remaining work is the actual SCO-to-DSP/IIS input and capture/DMA path;
the precise missing clock/routing/driver condition has not yet been isolated.
It cannot be reported as solved by installing a utility package or selecting
HFP alone.

Final state: original PSKey value 0, A2DP playback restored, headset still
paired/bonded/trusted/connected, voice and BT capture PCMs closed, pointer
debug disabled and no active Call objects. Both Debian slots retain BlueZ
5.82-1.1+e5.2 and the boot/rfkill fixes. Diagnostic logs and own-unit ODM
extraction are private under work/bluetooth-debian-20261002*.

## 59. Bluetooth SCO PCM input: missing IIS matrix and post-open SRC setup (2026-10-02)

Continued investigation obtained nonzero samples through the stock Bluetooth
DSP capture front end. This is a working, bounded PCM experiment, not yet a
deployed default desktop microphone or Bluetooth cellular-call implementation.
The controller retained its original PSKey throughout these tests; no PSTN
call was placed, answered or ended by the tooling.

### The ALSA SYS_IIS control was reporting a switch that never happened

The unit's route XML selects `SYS_IIS0=vbc_iis3` for both bt_sco and bt_mic.
The running mainline kernel has CONFIG_PINCTRL unset, so the pinctrl consumer
functions compile to successful no-ops. `sys_iis_sel_put()` updated its cache
and reported success while the physical matrix stayed unchanged. This was
missing from the earlier VBC-only routing experiments.

The unit's vendor pin table identifies IIS_INF0_SYS_SEL as control register 5,
bits 4:0, in the QogirN6Lite pin controller. Its live DT translates the base
to 0x642e0000 and declares value 11 for vbc_iis3_0. A temporary module checked
the compatible/resource, mapped only this register, saved the original field
and restored that field on unload without overwriting neighboring bits.
It allowed only the two selections declared by this unit's IIS0 states.

The actual register changed from 0x02904080 to 0x0290408b and back. Controlled
capture with the original selection 0 still failed with EIO and yielded no
samples; selection 11 produced nonzero PCM. The stock mode-0 controller thus
does have a working PCM input path, even though PipeWire's ordinary HCI SCO
source remains silent. AP capture hw:0,17 still timed out and is not the
validated input.

Read-only MCDT status also showed ADC4 write and read positions advancing,
with DMA request 14 and the configured 320-word watermark. A larger capture
buffer exposed the movement that the earlier short EIO probes missed. This
does not require an invalid-pointer workaround or a speculative DMA patch.

### BT SRC must be applied again after the capture scene starts

With the IIS matrix corrected, requesting 96000 mono S16 frames at 48 kHz
took about 6.096 seconds on mSBC. A request at 16 kHz was similarly slow.
Internal DSP microphone capture still completed its 2-second/48-kHz test in
about 2.15 seconds, so this was specific to the Bluetooth scene.

The existing local HAL reference opens the input PCM before its final device
selection, which reapplies VBC_SRC_BT_DAC and VBC_SRC_BT_ADC. Reapplying those
controls after the experimental PCM reached RUNNING corrected the timing:

| Codec | BT SRC reapplied | Captured frames/rate | Measured wall time |
|---|---|---|---|
| mSBC | 16000 | 96000 / 48000 Hz | 2.070 s |
| CVSD | 8000 | 96000 / 48000 Hz | 2.067 s |

Both completed normally with nonzero samples. Setting BT SRC or ADC2 SRC
only before opening the PCM did not correct the timing. A permanent capture
route needs this ordering on every new scene; declaring a different sample
rate for the incorrectly timed data is not the final solution.

A temporary PipeWire source fed the corrected 48-kHz PCM into pw-cat and
resampled normally for a 16-kHz recording client. The final 9-second bounded
test returned 143331 frames with nonzero data and no overrun. An earlier
prototype waited two seconds before attaching its client and overran; the
final prototype waits for node registration and attaches immediately.
The virtual source was removed afterward. The default BlueZ input proxy has
not been redirected to this path. The live numeric meter showed large level
changes, but the user's spoken-test reply arrived after its bounded window;
do not describe that as a synchronized speech validation of the final bridge.

WirePlumber's intended hardware SCO integration uses platform routing with
its offload loopback nodes; the relevant primary reference is its
[0.5.8 BlueZ monitor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PipeWire/wireplumber/0.5.8/src/scripts/monitors/bluez.lua)
and [platform example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PipeWire/wireplumber/0.5.8/tests/examples/bt-pinephone.lua).
That integration, playback/CP routing and transitions back to media remain
separate from the successful local capture experiment.

### Kernel commits and deployment boundary

The kernel repository now has three separate commits:

* `459f49dd3`: wider control-index packing and per-SoC pad offsets/pull layout,
  preserving the existing SC9860 probe behavior.
* `94822e4e0`: the GPL QogirN6Lite pin/matrix table from the local vendor tree.
* `d7484f958`: SYS_IIS rejects disabled pinctrl, propagates lookup/selection
  errors and updates its cache only after a successful switch.

A full Image/modules build enabled QogirN6Lite and also compiled SC9860;
the VBC object separately compiled with the original PINCTRL-disabled config.
The clean committed candidate is 6.18.54-e5-00067-gd7484f958a3f, retained with
its config and modules under out/bluetooth-pinctrl-20261002. It has not been
booted or deployed to the shared SD kernel. The live release remains
6.18.54-e5-00064-gc1bb703f034c, and the normal build config still leaves
pinctrl disabled pending that boot validation. Existing SD roots, registry
and userdata were not changed.

Evidence and temporary probe sources are private under
work/bluetooth-debian-20261002; HTTP-served Python probes are under
work/voice-20261001/serve. Tests restored mixer state, unloaded the register
probe and closed their PCMs. Final cleanup restores A2DP and removes temporary
audio recordings. No controller mode change or experimental background
capture service is a deployed fix.

## 60. Connection-switch testing needs exclusive microphone capture (2026-10-02)

The requested behavior is routing that follows headset connection/use and
returns to the device afterward, rather than permanently choosing Bluetooth.
Preparing an interactive test exposed another integration requirement:
FE_ST_CAPTURE_DSP (internal microphone, hw:0,2) and
FE_ST_CAPTURE_BTSCO_DSP (hw:0,14) both use MCDT_CHAN4. The vendor FE header
explicitly declares this sharing. GNOME Settings had multiple live capture
streams and held the internal PCM open when Bluetooth capture was attempted.
That attempt failed hw_params, followed by a DSP error with dsp_ready=0.
Recovery was followed by a reboot; its precise reboot cause was not captured.
The device returned to the existing 00064 kernel and audio service.

A switching implementation must release the previous physical capture before
opening the next scene. A successful virtual recording alone is insufficient:
a client can fall back to the internal microphone when its target disappears.
The temporary interactive test therefore checks that hw:0,2 is closed before
opening hw:0,14 and stops on a failed recorder. It holds the headset SCO
transport through Bluetooth offload acquisition instead of a recording of
the smart BlueZ proxy that could activate the internal source. It reapplies
BT SRC after the actual PCM is RUNNING.

The recovered test showed hw:0,2 closed, hw:0,14 RUNNING with its pointer
advancing, and the recording client's link explicitly connected to
`E5 蓝牙耳机麦克风测试`. Numeric levels included peak 6738/RMS 1297.45;
there was no concurrent internal-mic stream. This is stronger input-source
evidence than merely seeing nonzero data from a recording client.

The private bt-pw-user-test.py is a 15-minute test, not an installed service.
It temporarily selects its input, watches disconnection/call objects, and
restores the prior input preference only while its own preference is still
selected. Cleanup frees the physical capture and restores mixers before
removing the published source or moving clients back to the internal mic.
Speech feedback and physical disconnection recovery are requested from the
user. General reconnect policy, capture arbitration and cellular-call
handover remain unfinished. No PSTN call was initiated, answered or ended.

Evidence is under work/bluetooth-debian-20261002/user-test*, and the prototype
is under work/voice-20261001/serve/bt-pw-user-test.py. The controller firmware,
SD roots/registry and shared boot image were not modified.

### Synchronized speech and software disconnect/reconnect result

The user then replied “说过了” while the test was still running. The matching
13:05–13:06 window contained pronounced speech-level changes, including peak
23161/RMS 5888.8, followed by near-zero quiet intervals. hw:0,14 was RUNNING
and hw:0,2 was closed. The recording client's link to the test source had
already been checked explicitly, so this feedback validates the temporary
headset microphone input rather than an internal-mic fallback.

A software Bluetooth disconnect removed the headset transport. The test
released the capture channel, removed its source and register probe, and
PipeWire selected Internal Microphone. A subsequent 2-second internal-mic
capture completed with rc=0 in 2.229 seconds, confirming the channel and DSP
were usable afterward. Both capture PCMs were closed at completion.

Disconnect produced an expected low-level arecord I/O error when SCO ended
and a stale-device RPC diagnostic after BlueZ removed its device global.
The prototype was adjusted to skip that RPC and profile selection when the
device is gone. Its teardown had nevertheless completed; this was not a
new DSP failure. Reconnecting succeeded with the bond/trust retained, and
A2DP was explicitly restored afterward. Physical headset power-off, general
automatic reconnect/capture policy and Bluetooth telephone audio are still
unverified or unfinished. No call-control operation was performed.

Evidence: user-speech-feedback.txt, user-test-disconnect.txt,
user-test-reconnect.txt and user-test-media-restored.txt under the same
private work directory. The interactive test has ended; no test microphone
service remains active.

## 61. SCO switching release bundle (2026-10-02)

The capture ownership fix is now in the mainline kernel commits `af3bdc64e`
and `20f1a47fc`. The latter rejects a competing DSP capture scene before
firmware startup; the former clears stale FE DMA ownership after failed setup.
The release build is `6.18.54-e5-00069-g20f1a47fc2cb`, with QogirN6Lite
pinctrl enabled so `SYS_IIS0=vbc_iis3` performs a physical matrix switch.

Debian’s rootfs now contains an exclusive per-user capture broker. It publishes
one `e5_microphone` source through PipeWire, opens the internal or HFP SCO FE
only while a client is using that source, takes the BlueZ SCO offload lease for
HFP, reapplies the negotiated BT SRC after the PCM reaches RUNNING, and releases
the old FE before switching. The internal ALSA microphone node is disabled from
the desktop graph to prevent two clients from claiming MCDT ADC4. CallAudio
remains the CP voice adapter and does not silently route cellular calls through
Bluetooth.

The one-click SD test package is private at
`out/e5-debian-sco-switch-20261002.tar.gz` (913 MiB). `flash-sd.sh` selects the
existing OpenWrt slot, serves the 4 GiB Debian image and shared boot image over
the USB LAN, runs the installer’s GPT/free-space/checksum preflight, registers
Debian A/B, flashes `boot_b`, and arms one trial boot. It never formats an
existing registered card and does not initiate a phone call. The package
contains the new kernel release, boot image, compressed rootfs, registry tools,
and SHA-256 manifest.

The UFI-TOOLS main repository has separate commits removing both TG group and
TG channel links and replacing the external donation QR with the user-provided
`donate.jpg` byte-for-byte. The mirrored Debian overlay carries the same assets.

## 62. 无模组 explained and fixed: a stack on an empty SIM slot asserted the CP (2026-10-04)

The unisoc plugin's power-up from `+CFUN: 0` attached **both** slots unconditionally, so
whenever one slot was empty it ran `+SFUN=2` and `+SFUN=4` for a slot holding no card and
the CP asserted -- `T_P_ATC PS CP assert in file mnphone_api.c line 7401`, the third
assert of 47.3.  The assert silences the CP's AT server until the CP is reset, which
modem_control left on its own does only after minutes, so every command afterwards timed
out, ModemManager marked the modem invalid after ten of them, `mmcli -L` answered *No
modems were found*, and the info screen showed 「无模组」.  ModemManager replays the same
power-up from its event cache at every start, so it re-asserted on every boot.

Nothing on the SIM side was involved, which is what settled it -- the same signature came
out of three different card states:

    no card in either slot        two boots (17:35, 17:40)                    7401
    广电 (46015) in slot 1        17:42, plus a single-variable run on the port    7401
    电信 (46011) in slot 1        the boot after the swap, at t=41.4 s         7401

The single-variable run is the one that made the case: bringing up **only** card 0
(`+SPACTCARD=0;+SFUN=2`, `+SPTESTMODEM=134,134`, `+SPSWDATA`, `+SPACTCARD=0;+SFUN=4`)
left no assert at all and the CP went on to `+CFUN: 1` and reported its networks; then
touching card 1 raised the assert counter from 3 to 4.

The fix (patch 07, E5REV 6) reads the slots first, with `+SPACTCARD=n;+CCID?` on each --
an error or an empty `+CCID:` is no card, the same test the SIM list uses -- and sends the
SIM power, the work mode and the stack only to the slots that answered.  `+CFUN?` is still
asked, so a phone with no card at all behaves as before.  `+CPIN?` was deliberately **not**
used as the gate: a command that fails inside that sequence returns through
`g_task_return_error`, `modem_power_up` then fails and the modem is dropped -- the very
symptom being removed.

Built on WSL (62.3) and installed the same day: `modemmanager-1.24.0-r914.apk`, added with
`apk add --allow-untrusted` over the USB bridge link, old daemon kept at
`/root/e5-mm-backup/ModemManager` (its sha differs from the installed one, which is the
only way to tell them apart -- see 62.3).  Verified with the 电信 card in slot 1 and slot 2
empty, `wan` held down the whole time so the card's data was never used:

    asserts before / after starting ModemManager    0 / 0     "timed out" lines   0
    mmcli -L                                        lists /org/.../Modem/0
    sim slot paths                                  slot 1: /Sim/0 (active), slot 2: none
    IMSI 460110030221044   ICCID 89860316240221719513   operator id 46011
    the CP directly: +CFUN: 1  +CPIN: READY  +CGATT: 1  +COPS: 0,2,"46011",11 (NR)

Two gates stay open: with **no card at all** the phone should now list a modem instead of
asserting (the cleanest form of the same test), and the 广电 card has to come back for
registration, data, and both slots filled -- `e5-sim` must keep working.

### 62.1 The 搜索网络 under it was my own `ifdown wan`, not a plugin defect

With the assert gone, one symptom stayed: `mmcli` reported `state: disabled` while the CP
was at `+CFUN: 1` and attached, the status API returned `operator: null, registration:
null`, and the screen showed 「搜索网络」 even though `quality: 97` said there was signal.
Enabling it by hand cleared that in about two seconds:

    mmcli -m 0 -e 1     -> "successfully enabled the modem"
    3GPP registration (unknown -> registering -> home), packet service (unknown -> attached)
    state changed (enabled -> registered);  operator CHN-TELECOM, tech 5gnr

The first version of this section blamed the plugin's power-up path and asserted that the
OpenWrt `modemmanager` protocol "contains no `--enable`".  **That was wrong, and the
evidence had already been in my own output** -- `/lib/netifd/proto/modemmanager.sh:624`:

    mmcli --modem="${device}" --timeout 120 --enable || {
            proto_notify_error "${interface}" MM_MODEM_DISABLED
            return 1
    }

netifd enables the modem as a step of bringing `wan` up, which is precisely the thing I
had taken down to protect the SIM's data allowance.  A cold boot with a card in slot 1 and
slot 2 empty settles it: **no assert at all**, and the modem reached `state: connected`,
`operator id: 46011`, `registration: home`, packet service attached.  So this layer needs
no patch: `disabled` is MM reporting honestly that nobody asked it to enable, and every
status surface renders that as 搜索网络.  The other dismissal in that draft ("restarting
MM while `+CFUN` was already 1 still produced `disabled`") is consistent with the same
explanation -- with `wan` down there is no caller at all.

The measurement lesson is the reason this paragraph exists: a keyword grep whose output
was truncated by a `tail` was read as an absence.  The line I said did not exist was in
the same tool result, three of the six matches I printed.

One more correction, because the symptom returned on a boot where nobody had called
`ifdown`: "nobody asked it to enable" is only half the story.  After a bearer loss
something asks it to **disable** -- netifd's stop path runs `mmcli --disable` for any
teardown of `wan` unless the interface sets `disable_modem='0'` -- and that is what 63
fixes.

### 62.2 The COM29 the E5 gives the host is a root shell

The gadget (`0525:a4a1`, UDC `musb-hdrc.1.auto`, configfs instance `linux`) binds two
functions: `ncm.usb0`, which is the `UsbNcm` adapter and the 192.168.9.1 bridge, and
`acm.GS0`, which Windows enumerates as COM29 (`\Device\USBSER000`).  On the guest that is
`/dev/ttyGS0`, and `/etc/inittab` runs `ttyGS0::askfirst:/usr/libexec/login.sh` behind
`/bin/login -f root`: asserting DTR/RTS and writing a CR returns the OpenWrt banner and a
**root shell with no password**.  It is a control path that survives a disabled NCM
adapter or a broken network -- and a physical-access hole, so it should not be described
anywhere as password-protected.  From Windows the port is opened exclusively
(`dwShareMode=0`; a second handle gets `err=5`), so every read and write needs its own
timeout or the caller hangs on it.

### 62.3 Building one package without a container, and what the release number really is

`E5_DOCKER=none` (build-modemmanager.sh) runs the container's command list on the host
instead, taken out of the same file so the two cannot drift apart.  It was used on WSL
Debian 13.5 -- trixie, the same userland as the `debian:trixie` image -- with the tree on
the ext4 root: `/mnt/...` is a 9p mount and the Windows working copy is CRLF, so the build
ran from a Linux clone of the repository.  The only host package the container image had
and this host did not was `curl`, which the script uses **before** it reaches the
container, to fetch the release buildinfo.

Measured on the resulting package: `modemmanager release 8 -> 914`, i.e. the feed's
`PKG_RELEASE` is **8** for 25.12.5, not the 11 that the script's own example comment
claimed.  The phone came with **r911** installed.  `1805436` bytes and an `Apr 10 2025`
mtime were identical for the old and the new daemon, so neither size nor date can tell the
two builds apart -- compare sha256, or grep the binary for a string only the patch adds.

## 63. 「搜索网络」 with a working network: netifd puts the modem in flight mode when it loses the bearer

The screen said 搜索网络 with no signal, and the CP said otherwise: `AT+CFUN?` = 1,
`AT+COPS?` = `0,0,"CHN-TELECOM",11`, `AT+CGATT?` = 1.  `mmcli -m 0` was in the middle:
`state: disabled`, `packet service state: detached`, so the 3GPP interface was never
queried and `/api/status` returned `operator: null, registration: null, quality: 0` --
which is exactly what app.js renders as 搜索网络.  Section 62.1 blamed this on our power-up
path never enabling the modem; that was wrong twice: netifd does enable (62.1), and the
`disabled` state was not a missing enable but an explicit **disable** on teardown.

### 63.1 The teardown, from the log of the boot that did it

wan autostarted and dialled properly -- `21:57:44 Network device 'sipa_eth0' link is up`,
then `connected`, operator 46011.  62 s later (`connection #1 finished: duration 62s`):

    21:58:47 kern sipa_dele: smsg_recv, ... chan=120, type=5, flag=0x2, value=0x00000000
    21:58:47 netifd: Interface 'wan_6' is disabled
    21:58:47 netifd: Network alias '' link is down
    21:58:47 netifd: Interface 'wan_6' has link connectivity loss
    21:58:47 netifd: wan (9272): stopping network
    21:58:47 MM    [modem0] processing user request to disable modem...
    21:58:50 MM    3GPP registration state changed (home -> unknown)
    21:58:50 MM    access technology changed (5gnr -> unknown)
    21:58:50 netifd: wan (9272): successfully disabled the modem

and nothing brought it back in the following twenty minutes (`ifstatus wan` =
`"up": false, "autostart": false`).  One transient loss of the data link therefore costs
the registration, the signal reading and the whole hotspot, permanently.

The disable is not ModemManager's doing.  `/lib/netifd/proto/modemmanager.sh:878-882`:

    local disable="$(uci_get network "$interface" disable_modem "1")"
    if [ "${disable}" -eq 0 ]; then echo "Skipping modem disable"
    else mmcli --modem="${device}" --disable; fi

`disable_modem` defaults to 1: every stop of wan -- whatever caused it -- flight-modes the
modem.  A bearer loss is not a reason to leave the network, so the default becomes 0.  How
that ships is in 63.5 (a package patch, not a hand-set option in `/etc/config/network`).

Measured on the device after `uci set network.wan.disable_modem=0`, taking wan down
on purpose:

    netifd: wan (14857): Skipping modem disable
    mmcli:  state: registered / packet service state: attached / operator id: 46011
    api:    operator "CHN-TELECOM", registration "home", tech "5gnr", quality 100, rsrp -80

The screen keeps the carrier, the technology and the signal bars across a bearer loss.

### 63.2 What that does not fix: the data path stays down

`ip link set sipa_eth0 down` reproduces netifd's half of the sequence (wan_6 loses the
link, goes down, is disabled) without reproducing the CP-side release, and it shows the
rest of the damage: the parent `wan` still reports `"up": true` and ModemManager stays
`connected`, but **the default route is gone** and `ping` answers `Network unreachable`.
`ip link set sipa_eth0 up` does not restore it; only `ifup wan` (a fresh dial) does.

Two ways to close that were measured and rejected:

* `option force_link='1'` on wan does not keep the dynamic `wan_6` child alive -- applied,
  re-tested, sequence unchanged, so the option was reverted rather than shipped.
* a hotplug handler that re-dials on `if-down` cannot be written safely in this build:
  `strings /sbin/netifd | grep -aiE 'reason|ifdown'` yields only `ifdown`, i.e. there is no
  `IFDOWN_REASON`-style plumbing, so a handler could not tell an operator's deliberate
  `ifdown` (the way a data-capped SIM is protected) from a link loss.  Auto-redial would
  fight that, so it is not installed.

Still open then, and open now: why the CP releases the sipa data link at all.  It is not a
60 s timer -- later sightings are 23:09:12 and 23:43:47, at 43 s and 88 s of bearer life --
and the kernel's `sipa_rm SIPA_RM_RES_CONS_WWAN_DL/UL` toggles `2->0` and `0->1->2` every few
seconds the whole time the bearer is up, so a carrier blip on `sipa_eth0` is normal traffic
here and only the long one matters.  63.5 has what one of them looks like without my
intervention, and what still goes wrong in that case.

### 63.3 Traffic accounting for this session (the capped SIM)

`/proc/net/dev` on `sipa_eth0`, cumulative for one boot: after the boot dial
`rx 18675 / tx 7743`; after three short test dials `rx 138442 / tx 141479`.  My own
requests were two `ping -c 1/-c 2` packets to 223.5.5.5, so the growth is not mine:
`br-lan rx 291967 / tx 450694` and `usb0 rx 295701 / tx 609480` say the attached **host
PC is using the bearer as its default gateway**, and Windows background traffic is what
drains the card.  With a 10 MB SIM that is the thing to watch, not the probes.

### 63.4 Driver note: this busybox has no `stty`

`repo-status/_e5sh.py` ran `stty -echo 2>/dev/null` at login, which this device answers
with `ash: stty: not found` -- silenced by the redirect, so echo stayed on and long
command lines silently lost bytes (measured: a 320-character line arrived as 176 bytes).
That is what truncated the script uploads.  The driver now matches the *last* occurrence
of both markers, writes in <=150-byte pieces and reads `wc -c` back after every one, so a
lost byte fails loudly instead of shipping half a script.

### 63.5 The fix is in the package, not in a config I set by hand

63.1 left the fix sitting in `90-e5`, which meant it only reached a device whose
`/etc/config/network` the script was allowed to write, and it left every device I had not
touched broken.  That is not a product fix, so it moved down a layer: the default of
netifd's own option is changed in the shipped proto script
(`openwrt/patches/modemmanager-package-no-flight-mode.patch`, E5REV 6 -> 7, so
`modemmanager-1.24.0-r915.apk`), and the `90-e5` option went away again -- one mechanism.
`option disable_modem '1'` still asks for the old behaviour per interface.

Measured after installing r915 with **`disable_modem` removed from `/etc/config/network`
altogether** (`grep -c disable_modem /etc/config/network` = 0):

    23:44:55 netifd: wan (19383): Skipping modem disable
    mmcli   : state: registered / packet service state: attached / operator id: 46011
    api     : operator "CHN-TELECOM", registration "home", tech "5gnr", quality 100
    23:45:42 ifup wan -> "up": true, ping 1/1

and after a cold reboot at 23:47:52 the same device came up by itself dialling:
`23:49:32 Interface 'wan' is now up`, `state: connected`, API `quality 100`, ping 1/1, with
23 KB (`rx 14568 / tx 8604`) for the whole boot.

Two of my own bugs showed up on the way and are worth recording because they were silent:

* `_e5xfer.py`/`_e5run.py` stripped `\r\n` from every file they pushed -- harmless for
  scripts, corrupting for a binary payload, and the sha check could not see it because it
  compared the transformed bytes on both sides.  The first r915 install therefore died with
  `unable to select packages: .../modemmanager-rpcd-...apk (no such package)`.
* `apk add -U` refreshes the repository indexes, i.e. it reaches for the network even when
  the two `.apk` files are already on the device.  With `wan` down it failed as
  `wget: Operation not permitted`; without `wan` down it would have spent the capped SIM's
  data.  The r914 install used plain `apk add --allow-untrusted <files>`, and that is what
  works.

A third test result refines 63.1: the `wan_6` link loss and the parent teardown are two
separate events.  The spontaneous one at 23:09:12 (no operator action at all) was

    23:09:12 kern sipa_rm: SIPA_RM_RES_CONS_WWAN_DL state changed 2->0
    23:09:12 netifd: Network device 'sipa_eth0' link is down
    23:09:12 netifd: Interface 'wan_6' has link connectivity loss -> is now down -> is disabled

with **no `proto_mm_stop` line at all** -- the parent was never stopped, and ModemManager
stayed `connected`.  The damage in that case was the address and the default route going
with the carrier while `ifstatus wan` still answered `"up": true`; it healed again by
itself within the next two minutes.  So the fatal 21:58:47 variant (parent stopped, modem
flight-moded, 20 min of nothing) is the one the package fix removes, and the
"up-but-no-route" variant is a separate, still-open netifd/sipa interaction.
`option force_link='1'` was tested in both places -- on the interface and on a
`config device` section for `sipa_eth0` -- and neither kept `wan_6` alive, so it is not the
answer and is not in the configuration.

## 64. A reboot from the card came back in Android: the card install never made itself
## the default boot

`reboot` inside the SD-form Linux at 22:55:17 put the phone in **Android**: no `192.168.9.x`
adapter on the PC, no COM29, `adb devices` showing `ums9158_1h10` with `ro.boot.slot_suffix=_a`,
and telnet to 192.168.9.1 "succeeding" only because the local fake-IP TUN answers anything.
That last one is the trap: a TCP connect that succeeds from `198.18.0.1` is the proxy, not
the device -- `getsockname()` has to be the bridge address before any of it counts.

The chain is documented and was simply never closed for a card install.  `boot/init`
(`e5-linux/boot/init:670`) restores slot a unless the rootfs says
`/etc/e5linux/default-boot = linux`, and `e5-boot-ok` only re-arms slot b when that file
says linux (`e5-next-boot --rearm` printed exactly `default boot is not linux, nothing to do`
at 23:01:39).  Nothing wrote that file:

* `92-e5-default-boot` ran, but its gate was `E5_DEFAULT_BOOT=linux` from
  `/etc/e5/install.conf`, which a card install does not set;
* the other route -- `flash.py --boot-openwrt` writing `openwrt-default-boot=linux` into
  Android's userdata, which `e5-boot-ok` reads at `/mnt/e5-data/e5linux/` -- cannot work on
  the card form either, because in this shape the phone's userdata is not mounted at all
  (`/mnt/*/e5linux` does not exist, `ls` says so).

So the card boots, works, and hands the next boot back to Android.  A hotspot that turns
itself into a different operating system on reboot is not a product, and the user's own
`rom/boot-linux.bat` existing at all is the same symptom.

Fix, at the source (`openwrt/overlay/etc/uci-defaults/92-e5-default-boot`): a card in the
slot is the system the user put there, so `/etc/e5/sd-root` alone is the request to keep it.
`e5-next-boot linux` refuses a trial image (`e5.openwrt=` on the kernel command line), so a
test boot still cannot make itself permanent, and `e5-next-boot android` still wins because
the script stops when `/etc/e5linux/default-boot` already exists.

On this device the state was set by hand for the moment (`e5-next-boot linux`), and the
loop was then measured end to end:

    before: misc bootloader_control = 5f61...9f001e...   (slot a -- Android)
    after : 5f62000042434142010200009e002f...           (slot b armed, tries 2)
    reboot 23:47:52 -> 23:50:50 up 2 min, still Linux, still slot b
    23:48:29 user.notice e5-boot-ok: slot b re-armed

The `--rearm` line is the proof the mechanism now runs on its own; before the change the
same boot logged `default boot is not linux, nothing to do` instead.

## 65. The image can be built on a host with no container runtime, and what that took

Both fixes of 63.5 and 64 were in the tree, but nothing on the build machine could turn
them into an image: `openwrt/build-rootfs.sh` ran five container steps and had no host
path (only `build-modemmanager.sh` had one), and `openwrt/make-flash-bundle.sh:11` says
the same thing from the other side (`E5_IMAGE_FROM` exists because "build-rootfs.sh needs
docker").  Docker is not an option on this machine, so the image had to come from CI --
which is a 51 minute round trip through a fork's runner for a change of one line.

What was measured before any code was written, because the obvious assumption was wrong:

* the OpenWrt tree the package build leaves in `/build` has a **host** apk:
  `staging_dir/host/bin/apk`, `apk-tools 3.0.5, compiled for x86_64`, and OpenWrt drives
  it exactly this way for its own arm64 images (`include/rootfs.mk:48`:
  `IPKG_INSTROOT=$(1) $(FAKEROOT) $(STAGING_DIR_HOST)/bin/apk --root $(1) --keys-dir ...
  --no-logfile --preserve-env`).  An x86_64 apk installing into an aarch64 root is not a
  trick, it is how the release images are built.
* against the unpacked armsr rootfs: `update` gave `OK: 11170 distinct packages
  available`, `add iwinfo` put `libiwinfo.so.20230701` in the target root and wrote its
  database and world, `search`/`info`/`del` all rc=0.
* the one real gate: apk execve's a package's `post-install` inside the target root, so on
  x86_64 it died with `* execve: Exec format error` and `add` returned 1.
  `qemu-user-static` is the fix, but **WSL does not register binfmt at boot** --
  `/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/` held only `register status WSLInterop` after the install.
  Writing the package's own `/usr/lib/binfmt.d/qemu-aarch64.conf` line into
  `/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register` gave `flags: POF`, and then `chroot $R /bin/sh -c
  'uname -m'` printed `aarch64` and `apk add` ran the post-install with rc=0.  The `F`
  (fix binary) flag is what makes it work inside a chroot at all.
* `--no-scripts` and `--scripts` are not *global* options in this apk (`unrecognized
  option`); `apk add --help` lists `--scripts[=BOOL]` and `--force-no-chroot`, so a
  scripts-free path exists, but with binfmt it was not needed.

So `E5_DOCKER=none` was added to `build-bluez.sh` (25 lines) and `build-rootfs.sh` (136),
as additions only -- `git diff --numstat` says `25 0` and `136 0`, no container-path line
changed.  The commands are the script's own, extracted from `$0` the way
`build-modemmanager.sh` already did, so the two paths cannot drift; what changed is only
how they are reached: the four static helpers cross-compile with
`aarch64-openwrt-linux-musl-gcc` from the same staging_dir (each checked for `ARM aarch64`
and `statically linked`), `docker import` becomes an unpack, the assembly runs in a chroot
of that unpack with the container's mount points bind-mounted at the same `/in/...` paths
(so the apk that installs the packages is the image's own aarch64 one), Noto Sans CJK
comes from the host's apt (that package is `Architecture: all`), and the ext4 from the
host's `mke2fs -d`.

Three traps in doing it, each of which would have failed silently:

* the assembly block cannot be located by `e5-openwrt-base:` -- the `docker import` line
  contains that string too, and the extraction came back with 271 lines instead of 159.
  `/bin/sh -euc '` is the unique anchor.
* the image block cannot be located by `alpine:3.22 sh -euc '` -- the sed that does the
  locating contains that string, so it matched itself.  It is anchored on its own first
  and last lines instead.
* a leftover `/out/` cannot be checked as a substring after the rewrite, because the path
  it is rewritten to (`$TOP/out/openwrt`) contains one.  The check is for what the two
  ends of the block must then say.
* and the base rootfs's `/etc/resolv.conf` is a symlink to `/tmp/resolv.conf`, which is
  dangling in a fresh unpack: `cp` refuses to write through it, so it is removed first.
  The assembly puts the symlink back in the image it writes.

The result, measured: bluez `5.83 release 1 -> 902` (five packages, about four minutes)
and `e5-openwrt-25.12.5-generic.ext4.gz` of 150,915,480 bytes, whose own build log says
`modemmanager 1.24.0-r915 installed`, `info screen packages: 13`, `transplanted from an
earlier image: cog libcogcore libwpewebkit`, `used: 313M of 1024 MiB`.  Set against the
image CI built at `30f37d5`, package by package from each image's own apk database:

    new packages: 348      old packages: 348      differing lines: 4
    < modemmanager 1.24.0-r913        > modemmanager 1.24.0-r915
    < modemmanager-rpcd 1.24.0-r913   > modemmanager-rpcd 1.24.0-r915

That is the change being built and nothing else, which is the point of building it twice.

The boot image was not rebuilt.  The kernel did not change, `upstream/out-release` (Image.lk,
modules, root-modules.tar) does not exist on this host, and `upstream/build-native.sh` --
which would be the container-free way to make it -- has never been run by anything.  So the
bundle reuses `boot.img`, `boot.json` and `boot-misc-slot-b.bin` byte for byte (`0370af9e...`
on both sides) and takes the root modules out of the previous image with a loop mount: 24
audio modules and `sipc_wwan.ko`, both vermagics `6.18.54-e5-g20f1a47fc2cb`, which is the
directory name and the release in the reused boot image's `files/VERSION`.  `files/VERSION`
in the new bundle says all of this rather than implying a from-scratch build.

Flashing it is where the device disagreed with the tooling.  `flash.py --check` verified
the package (all 15 SHA256SUMS entries) and found the device with root already granted
(`uid=0 ... context=u:r:ksu:s0`), then stopped at `ro.boot.verifiedbootstate == orange`
(`flash.py:293`).  This unit reports:

    ro.boot.verifiedbootstate    green
    ro.boot.flash.locked         1
    ro.boot.vbmeta.device_state  locked
    ro.boot.veritymode           enforcing

while booting our own slot-b boot image, which a genuinely locked verified boot would not
do -- the uboot is modified and the property lies.  So `install_sd` is unreachable on this
unit.  No assertion was patched to get past it; the flasher's own `--update` path was used,
which does not call `android_checks` and does the same work from inside the running OpenWrt.

`--update` could not run from this PC either: it serves the files over HTTP on the PC and
the device fetches them, and inbound to Windows is blocked -- the device's `wget` reported
`Failed to send request: Operation not permitted`, and an earlier `nc` from the device to a
listener here timed out.  So the same device-side steps were run over the direction that
does work (the PC connects out, the device listens), with sha256 compared at both ends:
the image (150,915,480 B in 13.8 s, `ef9c34c8...`), `e5-gpt` (`9b52feb3...`, already the
same bytes as the device's `/usr/libexec/e5-gpt`) and `device-install-image.sh`
(`9ee586a2...`), then `sh /tmp/dii.sh /root/openwrt.ext4.gz`.

`device-flash-boot.sh` was deliberately **not** run.  It rewrites the first 56 MiB of
boot_b; that region was verified equal to the bundle's expectation instead, which is
stronger than rewriting identical bytes into the partition that is currently booting:

    dd if=/dev/block/by-name/boot_b bs=1048576 count=56 | sha256sum
      = cb54eaae454ebb1ba4e970ba765a98cf48d4d8e75c801eb4b71d2df2f14bead3
      = boot.json:sha256_head56m
    misc bootloader_control = 5f62...9e002f00...9bf8546d = boot.json:misc_slot_b_trial_hex

The install, in the installer's own words:

    == the card: /dev/mmcblk1, running from partition 1 (generation 0), the image 1024 MiB
    == a new root partition on the card: e5root2 (2 2101248 4722687)
    == keeping the configuration of /
    == the device's files copied in
    installed: card partition 2 (780f0f8, generation 1), started at the next boot

`e5-os openwrt` then printed `openwrt is not installed` (rc=1): this card has no SD system
registry (`/mnt/e5-boot/format` is absent), so there is nothing for the selector to select.
Worth knowing -- `flash.py`'s `--update` runs its device-side steps under `set -e`, so it
would have reported failure at that same point with the install already complete.

After the reboot, and again after a cold one, all of it held:

    root dev: /dev/mmcblk1p2   image-version: 780f0f8   sd-gen: 1   sd-trial: (gone)
    boot/init: stage=sd-candidate /dev/mmcblk1p2 gen=1 trial
               stage=openwrt-sd-trial /dev/mmcblk1p2
               stage=default-boot-linux (slot a restore skipped)
    e5-boot-ok: the card update's first boot is up: kept (780f0f8)
    e5-boot-ok: slot b re-armed            (and again on the cold boot)
    /lib/netifd/proto/modemmanager.sh is owned by modemmanager-1.24.0-r915
    878: local disable="$(uci_get network "$interface" disable_modem "0")"
    disable_modem in /etc: 0 file(s)       /etc/e5linux/default-boot: linux
    mmcli: state connected, operator id 46011, packet service attached
    wan up 34 s after boot, sipa_eth0; infoscreen CHN-TELECOM/home/5gnr
    hotspot ssid Link, key sha256 b3bce63f... -- identical to the pre-install backup

`stage=default-boot-linux (slot a restore skipped)` is 64's fix working in the boot chain,
and `sd-trial` being gone is the trial having been accepted rather than merely survived.

Not measured, and not claimed: whether the ~200 MB of packages this build downloaded went
over the cellular link.  The device rebooted twice before its counters were read, so the
window is gone; the PC's route table has the E5's `usb0` at metric 8000 behind a metric-50
default, which is indirect evidence only.  G1 (a boot with no card) and G3 (广电 46015/NR,
the dual-slot matrix, `e5-sim`) are still unrun.
